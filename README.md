Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pulibrary/pulfalight/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/pulibrary/pulfalight?branch=master)

This is an implementation of ArcLight being implemented as a replacement for the
 Princeton University Finding Aids (PULFA) service.

### Development

#### Setup
* Install Lando from https://github.com/lando/lando/releases (at least 3.0.0-rrc.2)
* See .tool-versions for language version requirements (ruby, nodejs)

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
```
(Remember you'll need to run the above commands on an ongoing basis as dependencies are updated.)

#### Starting / stopping services
We use lando to run services required for both test and development
environments.

Start and initialize solr and database services with `rake pulfalight:server:start`

To stop solr and database services: `rake pulfalight:server:stop` or `lando stop`

#### Run tests
`bundle exec rspec`

#### Start development server
- `rails s`
- Access Pulfalight at http://localhost:3000/

### Configuration
Please see [the ArcLight
documentation](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/wiki/Indexing-EAD-in-ArcLight#repository-configuration)
for information regarding the configuration of repositories in ArcLight.

### Indexing documents into Pulfalight

Documents are indexed from the EADs which are stored in a subversion
repository.

#### Retrieving the EAD-XML Documents
Documents are available from Princeton University Library staff, and should be
populated into the `eads/pulfa` directory, yielding a structure similar to the
following:

```bash
% ll eads/pulfa
[...] cotsen
[...] eng
[...] ga
[...] lae
[...] mss
[...] mudd
[...] rarebooks
```

##### Retrieving the Documents from SVN

One must ensure that SVN is installed locally:

*In a macOS Environment:*
```
brew install svn
```

###### Using `lastpass-cli` for authentication [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)

*In a macOS Environment:*
```
brew install lastpass-cli
```

Then please invoke the following:
```
lpass login username@domain.edu
bundle exec rake pulfa:checkout
```

###### Manually Retrieving the Documents (without `lpass`)
In order to download the EAD documents from Princeton University Library
servers, one will need to please retrieve the server name, as well as the
credentials for retrieving the documents from LastPass. Then, please download
the files with the following:

```
export PULFA_SERVER_URL=[the PULFA subversion URL]
export PULFA_USERNAME=[the PULFA subversion username]
svn checkout $PULFA_SERVER_URL --username $PULFA_USERNAME eads/pulfa/
```

One should now have access to the EAD files from within the local development
environment.

#### Indexing into a Development environment

Start sidekiq in a terminal window that you keep open:

`$ bundle exec sidekiq`

Use the rake tasks to index either a single file or a directory, e.g.:

`$ bundle exec rake pulfalight:index:file["mss/TC071.EAD.xml"]`

`$ bundle exec rake pulfalight:index:directory["mss"]`

Once the jobs are finished processing by sidekiq you'll need to either wait 5 minutes for the soft commit to occur or manually issue a solr commit:

`$ bin/rails c`

`> Blacklight.default_index.connection.commit`

#### Indexing the PULFA Documents into the Pulfalight Server Environment
One may also index the Documents remotely on the staging server by invoking the
follow Capistrano task:

```bash
bundle exec cap staging pulfalight:index_pulfa
```

### Citation Formatting

Citations are generated for collections and components, and rendered on the
show page for either of these resources. The default formatted repository
sources may be found and updated within the appropriate [configuration
file](./config/citations.yml).
