Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pulibrary/pulfalight/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/pulibrary/pulfalight?branch=master)

This is an implementation of ArcLight being implemented as a replacement for the
 Princeton University Finding Aids (PULFA) service.

### Development

#### Setup
* Install Lando from https://github.com/lando/lando/releases (at least 3.0.0-rrc.2)
* See .tool-versions for language version requirements (ruby, nodejs)

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
```
(Remember you'll need to run the above commands on an ongoing basis as dependencies are updated.)

#### Starting / stopping services
We use lando to run services required for both test and development
environments.

Start and initialize solr and database services with `rake pulfalight:server:start`

To stop solr and database services: `rake pulfalight:server:stop` or `lando stop`

#### Run tests
`bundle exec rspec`

#### Start development server
- `rails s`
- Access Pulfalight at http://localhost:3000/

### Configuration
Please see [the ArcLight
documentation](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/wiki/Indexing-EAD-in-ArcLight#repository-configuration)
for information regarding the configuration of repositories in ArcLight.

### Indexing documents into Pulfalight

#### Configuring ASpace

Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following information

```
ASPACE_USER=yourusername
ASPACE_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

#### Index "Interesting" EADs
A sub-section of all our collections have been identified and can be queued up
  for ingest via:

  `start redis-server`
  `bundle exec rake pulfalight:aspace:index_test_eads`

#### Full/Partial Reindex

In a Rails console, `Aspace::Indexer.index_new` can be run to either perform a
full reindex, or if that's happened before, index any changes.

This will move to a rake task when our production system is implemented.

Sidekiq must be running in a separate window to process the resulting jobs (see below.)

`$ bundle exec sidekiq`

Once the jobs are finished processing by sidekiq you'll need to either wait 5 minutes for the soft commit to occur or manually issue a solr commit:

`$ bin/rails c`

`> Blacklight.default_index.connection.commit`

#### Indexing into a Development environment

A subset of collections (the same that are run in specs) can be indexed into
  development via `bundle exec rake pulfalight:seed`

#### Adding new EADs to test suite.

1. Open up `app/services/aspace_fixture_generator.rb`
1. Add EAD ID to the `AspaceFixtureGenerator::EAD_IDS` constant.
1. If you're only interested in a subset of components, add them to the
   `AspaceFixtureGenerator::COMPONENT_MAP` constant.
1. `bundle exec rake pulfalight:fixtures:refresh_aspace_fixtures`

### Citation Formatting

Citations are generated for collections and components, and rendered on the
show page for either of these resources. The default formatted repository
sources may be found and updated within the appropriate [configuration
file](./config/citations.yml).
