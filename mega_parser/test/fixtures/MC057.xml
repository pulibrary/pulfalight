For 26 years, Franklin assisted developing countries in the creation, production, distribution, and use of books and other educational materials. Its efforts were based on the premise that through wider and improved education, underdeveloped nations could better utilize their human resources to help eliminate hunger, poverty, overpopulation, and economic paralysis.</abstract><physloc type="code">mudd</physloc></did><bioghist id="MC057_b1"><p>Franklin Publications was officially incorporated in the state of New York on June 5, 1952 as a nonprofit membership corporation for publication and translation of American books to native languages for distribution abroad. A group of American publishers, librarians and educators who were concerned with the state of education in developing countries founded the organization and named it after America's first book publisher, Benjamin Franklin. This group hoped that by facilitating and encouraging the publication and reading of American books in translation, international ties would be strengthened. Franklin's official purpose as stated in its certificate of incorporation was to:</p><p>publish and disseminate the printed word to the peoples of the world outside the United States, to stimulate interest in and promote the freedom, dignity and welfare of mankind; and to convey to them the knowledge and information relating to the people of the United States; and to stimulate interest in the history, government, culture, economy, technology, science and learning of the people of the United States.</p><p>The United States Information Agency (USIA) provided a $500,000 grant for the establishment of Franklin Publications, Inc. The organization stressed it was not a distributor of American propaganda nor was it an extension of the United States government, although it was originally conceived as a way of offering the services of the book publishing industry to the Government's overseas translation program. Contention erupted between Franklin and the USIA over the agency's desire to have final approval over the selection of titles. Franklin resented the agency's attempt to apply the same measures to Franklin's title selection as it applied to its own translation program. Franklin believed this limited their flexibility in working with foreign advisors and publishers. A series of discussions took place between the USIA and Franklin, which resulted in the USIA stating it had no desire to interfere with the normal publishing operations of Franklin. Their direct interest was in those projects financed by USIA funds. However, the USIA stipulated selected books were to have the following objectives, once Franklin had decided to focus its initial efforts on Arab-speaking countries in the Middle East:</p><list type="simple"><item>Minimize the difficulty of Arab-Western collaboration by reducing Arab ignorance and resentment of the West.</item><item>Help Arabs achieve a sound and comprehensive world picture in which they may play a respected role.</item><item>Aid Arabs in acquisition of insights into the character of responsible government, of public, social and economic policy, and of economic organization.</item><item>The central themes of Western thought from Plato onward, with special emphasis on those most eloquently stating the Western ideals of the dignity and freedom of individual men.</item></list><p>Franklin opened its first field office in Cairo, Egypt in June 1953 and by 1959 other field offices had opened in Tehran, Iran, Tabriz, Iran, Lahore, Pakistan, Dacca, Bangladesh, Djakarta, Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Beirut, Lebanon and Baghdad, Iraq. Franklin hired locals to staff its field offices and relied upon the advice of local advisors to select the types of books desired. The local advisors made the final decision on titles selected, but Franklin did supply American specialists to provide suggestions and comments if needed. Franklin did have the technical right to veto a title selection but rarely used it. It could not impose a selection on the local office but it would propose alternatives for out of date or low quality books. Once a title was selected and approved, Franklin secured the translation rights from the American proprietor, and then contracted with a local publisher and translator. Franklin paid for the translation, special editorial work, the introduction and artwork. The local publisher paid for paper (unless it was hard to secure, in which case Franklin would supply it), printing, binding, and all other normal publishing expenses. The publisher also agreed to pay Franklin ten percent of the local selling price. After the book was published, Franklin would aid the publisher in promoting, advertising and setting up jobber arrangements.</p><p>Franklin secured its first contract with a Cairo publisher in April 1953, and Edward R. Murrow's <emph render="italic">This I Believe</emph> was the first book published in Arabic on October 5, 1953. It was also the most popular, selling an estimated 30,000 copies in six months. Other early books included Bertha Parker's Basic Science Education Series, George Soule's <emph render="italic">Ideas of The Great Economists</emph>, Majid Khadduri's <emph render="italic">The Middle East in the Writings of Americans,</emph> Louisa May Alcott's <emph render="italic">Little Women</emph>, Edith Wharton's <emph render="italic">Ethan Frome</emph>, Charles Leonard's <emph render="italic">Why Children Misbehave</emph>, Thornton Wilder's <emph render="italic">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</emph>, and Herman and Nina Schneider's <emph render="italic">Your Telephone and How it Works</emph>. By June 1954, 132 titles had been published in Persian, Urdu, Turkish and Indonesian. Franklin did not maintain an office in Turkey but assisted its Ministry of Education with the publication of titles in the field of teacher training.</p><p>Franklin initially shied away from textbook publishing because "imperialist poisoning of the minds of children" was easy fodder for anti-American propagandists. However, at the request of the Ministries of Education of Afghanistan and Iran, Franklin began a textbook program in 1957. It supplied new design and artwork, carried out physical production of textbooks, and assisted in the improvement of content. It should be noted that many of Franklin's translated books made their way into local universities and were often used as "textbooks."</p><p>As the 1950s drew to a close, Franklin had gained the respect of the countries it served and thus survived a total of twenty-one changes of government in those countries. It prided itself in having no national or international political involvement, although it did receive funds and support from government officials in various countries. Its program had not only fostered intellectual development but also gave a boost to the developing country's local economy. By eschewing a "giveaway" policy, Franklin helped the local book industry instead of subsidizing the circulation of particular books.</p><p>The 1960s were a tumultuous time for Franklin. It continued to grow, expanding its programs to Africa and South America, but soon found itself in serious financial jeopardy. It began to redirect its activities from direct operational projects toward educational development. Specifically, it began to focus more on developing libraries and literacy campaigns, producing encyclopedias and dictionaries, developing textbooks, conducting training seminars in book publishing and writers' workshops, and technical assistance in printing, publishing and book selling. This redefinition also extended to a name change. Franklin Publications became Franklin Book Programs in 1964. The board felt the name Franklin Publications sounded too commercial and gave the impression it was a competitor to publishers. The organization's original name also failed to show its emphasis on books and that it was an international program.</p><p>This functional shift was also the result of dwindling financial support. The United States government as well as foreign governments were no longer interested in subsidizing traditional translation programs. Franklin did receive some financial support from a sister organization in September 1965. The members of the Council on Books in War Time, Inc. voted to dissolve the corporation and distribute its remaining funds to Franklin. However, by November 1967 Franklin was in a precarious financial situation. It reduced staff levels in all of its offices, eliminated marginal but relatively costly programs, confined the translation program to donor-supported titles, and established stricter budgetary controls. The president of Franklin stated in a November 1968 memorandum to the board of directors that although the translated book program had assisted local publishers, it had not had a major influence on the development of indigenous publishing, and was not a significant factor in educational and economical development. It was a relatively low-volume high-cost program that required a burdensome subsidy.</p><p>Franklin continued to redefine its mission to attract financial support, and in 1971-1972 established two task forces: one to consider a merger for Franklin while the other reviewed its programs, fundraising activities, and viability. The first task force recommended that Franklin remain independent if it could possibly do so while the other task force made several significant recommendations. It urged that "Franklin's role be expanded worldwide, it become an aggressive seeker of funds, and become a representative of a broad section of the American business and professional community in developing education, which is the key to the improvement of the quality of life in developing countries." Franklin continued to remain solvent and functioning until June 1978 when its board and members voted to dissolve the corporation after recognizing that for the most part Franklin's original mission had been achieved.</p></bioghist><descgrp id="dacs3"><scopecontent><p>The Franklin Book Programs Records contain the administrative records of this non-profit, educational organization. The collection contains minutes, correspondence, memoranda, reports, contracts, photographs and other audiovisual material documenting Franklin's twenty-six year existence. The material highlights the complexities of developing, managing and dissolving an organization that hoped to neutralize and overcome the effects of anti-American sentiment in the book publishing and distribution field.</p><p>The material within the folders is arranged in reverse chronological order unless otherwise noted. Researchers should be aware that Franklin was very inconsistent in regard to the placement of items. Although a particular subject, person, organization, etc. may have its own folder, it is highly recommended researchers check the general correspondence folders as well. Researchers will note in some instances there are A-Z correspondence folders as well as general correspondence folders. General correspondence usually contains internal correspondence, memoranda, etc. between the New York and field offices, while the A-Z folders contain external correspondence. However, at times the internal and external correspondence are combined and the folder is labeled general correspondence. There is also correspondence in Arabic, French, Persian, Spanish and Urdu.</p><p>Researchers should be aware that Franklin had two distinct sets of records. Duplicate copies of correspondence and cables to and from Franklin's field offices were made. Each was assigned a unique number and filed chronologically, while the duplicate was filed alphabetically by subject. The "chrono files" as Franklin referred to them, included all of the correspondence with the overseas offices during their service. Former executive director, Jack Kyle, admitted to many misfilings by the staff and having to use the chrono files to locate items. These chrono files are located at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin. However, we do have an incomplete index of chronological cable summaries, which are located in Series 2, Subseries 1.</p></scopecontent><arrangement><p>The collection is divided into five series that reflect the organization's arrangement of its files:</p></arrangement></descgrp><descgrp id="dacs4"><accessrestrict type="open"><p>Collection is open for research use.</p></accessrestrict><phystech><p>Access to audiovisual material follows the Mudd Manuscript

This series provides the most information on Franklin's operations but at the same time is quite frustrating due to numerous gaps and an inconsistent filing system. Ironically, an overzealous cross-reference system resulted in redundant files with copies of items filed in various places. Files were consolidated and duplicate items removed as part of this processing project.</p></scopecontent><c level="subseries" id="MC057_c00186"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1, New York Office Records</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1952/1978">1952-1978</unitdate><physdesc><extent type="computed">42 boxes (1 partial)</extent></physdesc></did><arrangement><p>No arrangement action taken or arrangement information not recorded at the time of processing.</p></arrangement><scopecontent><p>Subseries 1, New York Office Records, 1952-1978, includes incoming and outgoing correspondence, clippings, pamphlets, speeches, grant applications and memoranda of Franklin's executive directors (Datus C. Smith, Michael Harris, Carroll Bowen and Jack Kyle) and headquarters staff. Also to be found is the founding members' correspondence, including that of George P. Brett, Jr., Donald S. Cameron, Robert L. Crowell, Basil Dandison, Robert F. DeGraff, Charles E. Griffith, Malcolm Johnson, Dan Lacy, Datus C. Smith and Theodore Waller. This early material is arranged in reverse chronological order (the bulk of the records began to be arranged alphabetically in 1958), and includes information ranging from the naming of the organization to which countries would benefit most from its programs. The New York office was responsible for all of Franklin's international operations, and the administrative aspects of managing these offices are included here. Specific correspondence with its field offices is included in Subseries 3. This subseries highlights the New York Office's function of recruiting consultants for overseas projects, translation rights procurement, research and information gathering, program development including collaborative efforts with other organizations and businesses, fundraising and contract negotiation.</p></scopecontent><c level="file" id="MC057_c00187"><did><container

It contains correspondence, memoranda, reports, clippings, telegrams and proposals that provides an in-depth look at the relationship Franklin had with its field offices, the selection of titles, the nature of projects, as well as the success and failure of certain projects. Its "regular program" was the cornerstone of Franklin's operation and influenced special projects. The regular program was defined as the straight translation projects as opposed to special projects, which included encyclopedias, textbook projects, library development, workshops, etc. By the time Franklin ceased operating in 1978, its field offices had translated over 3,000 titles, produced several encyclopedias, conducted numerous surveys, and trained hundreds of people.</p></scopecontent><c

There are seven different groups, each arranged alphabetically, in this series. The largest grouping is the files arranged by author followed by authors whose works were out of print. These files mainly contain correspondence with the publishers to secure translation rights. However, there is some correspondence with various authors. Humorous correspondence with poet Allen Ginsberg is found in the folder "Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry." Franklin wrote to Ginsberg asking for permission to publish Ginsberg's poem, "The Shrouded Stranger." Ginsberg took issue with the selection and wrote, "I can only conclude that the man who made the selection is either a complete idiot who prefers a rhymed academic style poem no matter what-and has gone through all my works like a haystack looking for this particular type of needle that rhymes."</p><p>Following the files arranged by author, are cancelled contracts, author fact sheets, title catalogs and cards, which are broken down by language, AID Rights Fund material and rights contracts.</p><p>Franklin was contracted to help administer the Rights Fund, which was developed by AID to encourage the translation and publication of certain American books by helping to defray the cost of translation rights. While Franklin provided a reasonable, workable formula for the purchase and transfer of rights for books requested, the program hoped to foster a direct dialogue between the American and cooperating publishers.</p></scopecontent><c level="file" id="MC057_c02346"><did><container type="box">187</container><container type="folder">3</container><unittitle>Administrative</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1969/1976">1969-1976</unitdate><physdesc><extent type="computed">1 folder</extent></physdesc></did></c><c level="file" id="MC057_c02347"><did><container type="box">187</container><container type="folder">4</container><unittitle>Abbott, Nabia</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1964/1966">1964-1966</unitdate><physdesc><extent type="computed">1 folder</extent></physdesc></did></c><c level="file" id="MC057_c02348"><did><container type="box">187</container><container type="folder">5</container><unittitle>Abu Madi</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1959/1971">1959-1971</unitdate><physdesc><extent type="computed">1 folder</extent></physdesc></did></c><c level="file" id="MC057_c02349"><did><container type="box">187</container><container type="folder">6</container><unittitle>Ackoff, Russell L</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1973/1975">1973-1975</unitdate><physdesc><extent type="computed">1 folder</extent></physdesc></did></c><c level="file" id="MC057_c02350"><did><container type="box">187</container><container type="folder">7</container><unittitle>Adams, J.
