            Princeton University Library aims to describe archival materials in
            a manner that is respectful to the individuals and communities who
            create, use, and are represented in the collections we manage.
            However, for a variety of reasons, users may encounter offensive or
            harmful language, for example, language that is racist, sexist, or
            homophobic, in our finding aids. You may also encounter
            <%= link_to "harmful content", "https://library.princeton.edu/statement-harmful-content" %>
            in the paper and digital records within archival collections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff are currently implementing practices to address offensive or harmful language as part of routine description work. We recognize that terminology evolves over time and that efforts to create respectful and inclusive description must be ongoing. You can help us address this issue by reporting any <%= link_to "harmful or offensive language or content", "/archival_language" %> you encounter on this site by using the form below. If you would prefer to report this anonymously, you may leave the name and email fields blank.
