<p>Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Lorain, Ohio in 1931. She attended
            Howard University, graduating in 1953 with a degree in English, then received an MA in
            literature from Cornell University in 1955.</p><p>
         After a brief teaching stint at Texas Southern University, Morrison returned to teach at
            Howard in 1957. There, she married architect Harold Morrison, with whom she had two
            sons, Harold Ford Morrison (born 1961) and Slade Kevin Morrison (1964-2010). The two
            divorced around the time of Slade's birth, after which Morrison began working as a
            textbook editor for a division of Random House based in Syracuse, NY. In 1967, Morrison
            was promoted to senior editor and moved to New York City, where she worked with a number
            of emerging influential African-American writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Angela
            Davis, Henry Dumas, and Gayl Jones, in addition to editing The
               Black Book (1974), a compilation of African-American historical documents.</p><p>
         Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in
            1970. She has published a total of eleven novels to date, winning numerous literary and
            cultural awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Beloved in 1988, the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, the National
            Humanities Medal in 2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. In addition to
            her novels, Morrison has written non-fiction, poetry, children's literature (in
            collaboration with her son Slade), and dramatic works.</p><p>
         In 1983, she left her position at Random House to concentrate on writing and teaching,
            serving as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at SUNY Albany from
            1984-1989, then the Robert E. Goheen Professor in the Council of the Humanities at
            Princeton University until her retirement in 2006. During this time, she taught classes
            in creative writing, African-American studies, and, at Princeton, developed the
            interdisciplinary Atelier program. She has also served as a visiting professor and
            lecturer at numerous institutions, including Yale University, the University of
            Michigan, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University.</p><p>

The Additional Working Files subseries includes additional materials received after the bulk of the papers were arranged.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_d3e76d4b16d8926e9fea726438460942"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of files maintained by Morrison and her administrative assistants, including Ronaline Saunders, Rene Boatman, and John Hoppenthaler. The first subseries of files concern Morrison's book and writings projects, and include correspondence with editors, publishers, and translators, as well as publicity tour schedules and related material. The office files, maintained at Morrison's offices at SUNY Albany and later Princeton University, document Morrison's activities, including awards, conferences, lectures, interviews, etc., throughout her career as a public figure. The office files also include subject files pertaining to her publishers, literary agency, various professional organizations, and individuals; letterbooks of administrative correspondence sent by Morrison and her assistants, various requests received, and fan mail. The files from Morrison's home office are similar in content to the office working files, but are the primary location of book contracts and royalty statements.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_C1491_c5465" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Additional Working Files</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992-01-01/2018-12-31" type="inclusive">1992-2018</unitdate></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b21d0197ee15c2bd0493dca727d2559d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>The collection is open for research.
