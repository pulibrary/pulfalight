    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>José Emilio Pacheco was a poet, essayist, novelist and short story writer. He was born
            in Mexico City on June 30, 1939. Pacheco attended the National Autonomous University of
            Mexico, where he studied law and literature and worked for literary publications but did
            not earn a degree. He later taught at various universities in Mexico, United States,
            Canada, and England, including the University of Maryland at College Park, and the
            University of Essex, England. Pacheco also worked as director and editor of various
            journals and cultural supplements. He was given various awards during his lifetime,
            including the Premio Reina Sofía de Poesía Iberoamericana, and the Premio Miguel de
            Cervantes, both in 2009. He died in Mexico City on January 26, 2014.</p>  </bioghist>
