    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers consist of José Emilio Pacheco's handwritten notebooks, in which Pacheco appears to have recorded draft iterations of his writings, miscellaneous notes, and other information related to his creative process; diaries and journals containing handwritten dated entries; writings, such as drafts, excerpts, addenda, and final versions, including poetry, short stories, scripts, screenplays, essays, articles, and translations; a few writings by others; correspondence from various colleagues, publishers, family, and friends, including Octavio Paz, Juan Vicente Melo, Carlos Fuentes, José Miguel Oviedo, Sergio Galindo, Bruno Arcudi, Félix Grande, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Homero Aridjis, Carlos Monsivaís, Rosario Castellanos, José Bianco, and Vicente Rojo; printed materials, including periodicals, newspaper clippings, articles, publications, and broadsides; and other materials, including photographs, biographical documents, certificates, and materials related to awards given to Pacheco.</p>  </scopecontent>
