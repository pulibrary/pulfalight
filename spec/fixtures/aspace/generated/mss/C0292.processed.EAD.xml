    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of papers reflective of both Willard and Margaret Thorp's careers as authors and critics, Willard's years as a professor of English at Princeton University, and Margaret's early career in journalism. The bulk of the collection dates from the years (1930-1970) when they published the majority of their articles, reviews and books, gave their speeches, and when Willard taught his classes and was acting chairman of Princeton's English Department.</p><p> Willard's papers consist mainly of correspondence with professional colleagues; friends, particularly Allen Tate and Caroline Gordon, but also including T. S. Eliot, William Meredith, James Meriwether, Robert Penn Warren, Robert Lowell, Archibald MacLiesh, and John Berryman; organizations, such as the Modern Language Association, and the Association of Princeton Graduate Alumni; and publishers of his works, including the American Book Company, Charles Scribner's Sons, and the J. B. Lippincott Company. Much of the correspondence relates to books he wrote or contributed to, such as Modern Writing, The Lives of Eighteen from Princeton, Great Short Works of American Realism, and A Southern Reader. There are also manuscripts of articles and speeches Willard wrote, as well as class lecture notes of the courses he taught at Princeton (1932-1967), miscellaneous material regarding a senior poetry seminar, several diaries, publisher's contracts, photographs, printed matter, papers of others, and four recording of conversations with Thorp. Included is an album of original poems dedicated to Willard by seven Princeton poets, presumably his former students. A later accession consists of over 100 offprints of articles by contemporary literary scholars and critics; many of these pamphlets are inscribed to Thorp.</p><p> Margaret's papers consist of drafts of Charles Kingsley, 1819-1875 and Female Persuasion: Six Strong-Minded Women, speeches, articles, notebooks, correspondence with Allen Tate and Caroline Gordon, Vivienne Heigh (Mrs. T. S. Eliot), family letters and correspondence with her publishers, and family sketchbooks and photographs.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Margaret Louise Farrand Thorp (1891-1970), scholar, author, critic, and journalist, was born in East Orange, New Jersey, on December 3, 1891. She graduated from Smith College in 1914, received her M.A. from Smith in 1926, and her Ph.D. from Yale in 1934.</p><p> After receiving her B.A., Margaret worked on the staff of The Independent under the editorship of Hamilton Holt. A firm believer in the cause of the Allies, she was eager to get to France to serve in any way she could. The American Fund for French Wounded accepted her, and in late October 1917 she sailed for France on the Rochambeau. Once there, she edited The Weekly Bulletin issued by the Fund Cooperating with the American Red Cross for circulation in the United States. (Alice B. Toklas was one of its frequent contributors.) In her spare time Margaret worked in the canteens and as an unofficial nurse's aide in several hospitals. In March 1918 she transferred to the American Red Cross where she continued to do publicity work until after the Armistice. She was also a special correspondent to the Newark Evening Times and wrote faithfully in her own journals, recording all her experiences.</p><p> After returning from France, between 1921 and 1929, Margaret was Director of Publicity and Assistant Professor of English at Smith College. Also during this time she was a regular contributor to such publications as The Smith Alumnae Quarterly, the Christian Science Monitor, Scribner's Magazine, and the New York Evening Post. In 1929 she went to Yale to earn her Ph.D., and on June 12 of the following year married Willard Thorp, then an assistant professor at Princeton University.</p><p> Although Margaret did not continue teaching after her marriage, she continued to pursue her writing career. In 1937 she published Charles Kingsley, 1819-1875 with Princeton University Press. In 1969 Yale University Press published her popular film study, America at the Movies. In 1944 she collaborated with Willard on a textbook, Modern Writing, followed by another biography, Female Persuasion: Six Strong-Minded Women in 1949. Later writings include Neilson of Smith (1956), The Literary Sculptors (1965), and Sara Orne Jewett (1966).</p><p> In 1957 Smith College made Margaret Thorp an honorary Doctor of Letters. She died in Princeton on October 2, 1970, at the age of 79. She was a niece of Beatrix Farrand, Princeton's landscape artist.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>
         William Willard Thorp (1899-1990), literary historian, editor, educator, author, and
            critic, was born on April 20 in Sydney, New York. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
            Hamilton College in 1920, received an A.M. the following year from Harvard, and his
            Ph.D. in 1926 from Princeton University. That year he joined the faculty of Princeton
            and advanced from instructor of English in 1926 to the Holmes Professor of Belles
            Lettres in 1952, and was chairman of the English department from 1958-1963.</p><p>
         During his years at Princeton, Willard Thorp published a number of books, innumerable
            literary reviews and essays in philogical journals, and established himself as an
            editor. Included among his books are The Triumph of Realism in
               Elizabethan Drama (1928), Lives of Eighteen from
               Princeton (1946), A Southern Reader (1955), and
               American Writing in the 20th Century (1960). One of his
            best-known essays is "The Well of English, Now Defiled, or, Why Johnny Can't Write," a
            humorous piece with serious undertones in which Thorp laments the state of affairs of
            college writing. He edited with Howard Lowry the Oxford Anthology
               of English Poetry (Oxford University Press, 1935), and with various others
            edited Herman Melville, Representative Selections (American
            Book Company, 1938), and the widely-used Herman Melville,
               Moby-Dick (Oxford University Press, 1948), Literary
               History of the United States (first published in 1948), and Great Short Works of American Realism (Harper, 1968).</p><p>
         Aside from his literary accomplishments and his popularity with undergraduates, one of
            Willard Thorp's greatest contributions to Princeton University was the development in
            1942 of the special program in American civilization, now called the American Studies
            Program. He directed this for the first thirteen years, and strove to bring American
            civilization to light through studying culture, institution, intellectual tradition, and
            relationships among groups. The program grew until it included faculty and
            undergraduates from nine cooperating departments. One of the special interest courses
            taught by Thorp in this program was "The Age of Dryden."</p><p>
         Willard Thorp also kept busy traveling to various universities as a visiting professor.
            He went to the University of Virginia in 1947, was the Anderson Visiting Professor at
            the Rice Institute in 1952-1953, and taught summers at the University of Hawaii,
            University of Washington, Seattle, and Duke University.</p><p>
         Thorp retired from Princeton University in 1967, remaining in Princeton until his death
            at age 90 in 1990. He was honored in 1972 with the establishment of the Willard Thorp
            Thesis Prize in American Civilization, and in 1978 was awarded an L.H.D.</p><p>
