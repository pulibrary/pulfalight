<p>The Princeton University musical tradition dates back to as early as commencement 1759, when students sang an ode by James Lyon, a graduate that year who went on to a career in music composition. Since that time, the University has been host to a wide array of musical performances on a regular basis. Concerts and recitals by the University's many musical clubs and organizations, as well as performers from outside the University have been standard fare over the years. In the last several decades these performances have been funded in large part by the Friends of Music at Princeton.</p> <p>Instrumental music entered the musical scene at Princeton in the 1760's with the purchase of an organ. It soon proved to be an unpopular choice, however, for Princeton was a Presbyterian school at the time, and this was the first organ installed in a Presbyterian place of worship. It was never heavily used, and organ and vesper recitals did not become regular campus events until the installation of an organ in the Graduate College dining hall, which opened in 1913. Instrumental music in general only gained a popular following on campus in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Instrumental Club, the first of its kind on campus, was founded in 1876. Later additions included the Banjo Club, Mandolin Club, University Orchestra and University Band.</p> <p>The Princeton University Glee Club was founded in 1874. An offshoot of the now-extinct University Quartette, the Glee Club is the oldest singing group at the University. In the years following its formation, the Glee Club often collaborated and performed with the University instrumental clubs. The Glee Club began touring the country in the 1890s. More recently, they have spread their talent abroad through tours of Europe, Asia, and South America. In 1913, the Princeton Glee Club first performed with the Glee Clubs of Harvard and Yale, an annual tradition that endures to the present day.</p> <p>In 1894 the Princeton University Concerts series was founded by Philenas Fobes Fine (wife of Henry Burchard Fine, a professor and dean) and the Ladies' Musical Committee. In 1929 the Princeton University Concerts Committee was established and took control, which in conjunction with the Friends of Music has guided the concerts series ever since.</p> <p>Friends of Music at Princeton is a donor-supported organization that sponsors a wide variety of concerts at Princeton University. The concerts, usually in the Frank E. Taplin '37 auditorium in Fine Hall, are open to the public and free of charge, and feature professional musicians as well as talented amateur and student musicians. Friends of Music at Princeton was founded in the 1940s by Professor Roy Dickinson Welch, who was also the first chair of the Department of Music. Administrative support for the Friends of Music and the Princeton University Concerts Committee is provided by the Princeton University Concert Office, which handles accounting, event planning, and artist coordination.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Born in Saline, Kansas, Edward (Ed) Harford Phillips (1868-1944) moved west in 1882 to pursue cattle ranching. He primarily worked as a horse handler on multiple ranches, including James B. Kempton's XIT ranch near Terry, Montana, one of the largest cattle ranches in eastern Montana. A skilled horseman and steer roper, Phillips joined the cast of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show in New York in 1900 as a stunt horse rider. In 1902, Phillips married Mary (Marie) N. Kempton (1881–1946) with whom he had two children: Jean Sarah Phillips (1908–1985), who also performed in Wild West shows, and Joseph Edward Phillips (1913–1972).</p> <p>Marie Kempton Phillips, an accomplished horsewoman and relay rider, joined her husband as a performer in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. The couple celebrated their honeymoon in London while touring with the show during its four-month run at the Olympia Building beginning in December 1902. Over the next couple of years, the Phillips traveled back and forth from Montana to New York working various jobs at cattle ranches, farms, and race tracks, and performing in rodeo and horse-racing contests, and a Wild West show in Coney Island. From 1906 to 1912, the Phillips family lived at Cross L. ranch in Medora, North Dakota before moving back to Terry, Montana.</p> <p>In 1919, the family moved to Los Angeles, California, and Ed Phillips joined Tom Mix's stock acting company. He left after a year to work with cowboy stars such as Buck Jones, Harry Carey, Fred Thompson, William S. Hart, and Hoot Gibson, and others. From 1922 to 1930, the Phillips family lived and worked a farm in Merced before returning to Los Angeles where Ed again worked as a film actor and consultant for westerns. During his Hollywood career, Phillips was in movies made by Leo D. Maloney (1888-1929) and had minor roles in the movies "Gun Play" (1935) and "In Old Chicago" (1938), among others. His movie career ended with Columbia Studios (1939-1942). Phillips was an honorary member of the Chuck Wagon Trailers.</p> <p>Photographs and some information about Ed Phillips and the Kempton ranch can be found in Mark H. Brown and W. R. Felton's book, Before barbed wire; L. A. Huffman, photographer on horseback (New York, Holt [1956]). The Kempton ranch and family, including Ed and Marie Phillips, were also documented by photographer Evelyn Cameron whose farm sat adjacent to the Kempton's property.</p>  </bioghist>
