    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Robert Garrett Collection contains 113 Ethiopic codices (bound manuscripts), which are chiefly written in Ge'ez, the sacred and liturgical Afro-Asiatic language of Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. Some texts are in Amharic. Included among Ethiopic manuscripts at Princeton are Bibles, Gospels, Psalters, homilies, liturgy, saints' lives and miracles, theology, law, compilations on magic and divination, and other texts. Pseudepigraphic manuscripts include the Book of Enoch, which was used in R. H. Charles, ed., The Book of Enoch, Translated from Professor Dillmann's Ethiopic Text... (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893). A modest number of the manuscripts are illuminated. The two earliest manuscripts date from the 17th century: Garrett Ethiopic no. 1 (Bible) and no. 2 (Dersana Mika'el), both from the library of the Emperor Theodore (r. 1855-1868) of Ethiopia. However, most of the manuscripts at Princeton date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Texts are written in black ink on parchment. The quires are bound in a traditional style reminiscent of early Christian codices. The manuscripts are sewn with unsupported link-stitch and then laced into rough-hewn wooden boards or sometimes covered in blind-tooled leather. A number of manuscripts are in leather carrying cases, which allowed them to be worn over the shoulder or hung up on pegs in walls.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Garrett acquired 101 Ethiopic codices from Enno Littmann (1875-1958). Garrett acquired a dozen more codices from other sources. Many of the original owners' names appear on the manuscripts, occasionally in the form of specialized prayers.</p>  </custodhist>

<p>The manuscripts were given to Princeton University Library by Robert Garrett (1875-1961) in <date type="acquisition" normal="1942/1942">1942</date>. Garrett acquired 101 Ethiopic codices and 147 magic scrolls from Enno Littmann (1875-1958), who lead a Princeton expedition to Tigray, Ethiopia, in the autumn of 1905 (with Garrett's financial backing) and a German expedition to Aksum (Deutsche Aksum-Expedition) in the first few months of 1906. Littmann was an eminent German scholar who, during his long academic career, taught at Princeton, Strassburg, Göttingen, Bonn, and Tübingen. Most of the bound manuscripts and magic scrolls that Littmann collected in northern Ethiopia are at Princeton, but other manuscripts are in Germany (Berlin; Halle-an-der-Salle). Garrett acquired a dozen more codices from other sources.</p>  </acqinfo>

<p>In addition to the 113 Garrett Ethiopic codices, the Library also has an open collection called Princeton Ethiopic Manuscripts (C0776), acquired individually by gift or purchase. Since the 1990s, Bruce C. Willsie, Princeton Class of 1986, has been the principal donor. There is one Ethiopic manuscript in The Scheide Library (Manuscript 119).</p><p> The Library also has three substantial collections of <extref xlink:href="http://lib-dbserver.princeton.edu/mssimages/ethiopic/index.html" xlink:type="simple">Ethiopic magic scrolls</extref>.

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Robert Garrett was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 24, 1875. Garrett inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett, Princeton Class of 1868. After his father's sudden death in 1888, Garrett spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Fac-similes of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvestre (tr. by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949-50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script. Garrett returned to the United States in 1891 and soon after began his studies at Princeton University. He received his A.B. degree from Princeton in 1897. While in school, Garrett excelled in track and field athletics. In 1896 he competed in the first modern Olympic games in Athens, Greece, where he became the first champion in discus and shot put. After graduation he continued on in the family banking firm, Robert Garrett &amp; Sons, in Baltimore, Maryland. However, he maintained very close contact with his alma mater and in 1905 was elected a Life Trustee of Princeton University. Throughout his career Garrett also remained dedicated to his collecting hobby. He maintained from the beginning that his collection would one day be given to the Princeton University Library so that it would always be connected with academic research. He donated the bulk of his collection to the Princeton University Library in 1942. Robert Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland. In the end he had amassed a collection of over 11,000 volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C.-1900s.</p>  </bioghist>
