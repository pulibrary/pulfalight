    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Architect Stamo Papadaki was born in Athens, Greece, in 1906. He attended Athens Polytechnic and then moved to France, where he studied under Auguste Perret and others, and received his Diplome d'Architecte et d'Urbaniste in 1929. In 1935 Papadaki went to New York as the designer for American Houses, Inc., which specialized in prefabricated houses. His clients included the French government, UNESCO, and the New York Port Authority, for which he served as planner for the Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy) Airport. He also won a design competition for a pavilion for the New York World's Fair (1939-1940), served (1938-1946) on the Architectural Committee of the Museum of Modern Art (N.Y.), was an active member of CIAM (International Congress of Modern Art), and was one of the three foreign judges of the planning competition (1957) for the new Brazilian capital of Brasilia. In addition to his practice as an architect Papadaki also worked as art editor (1948-1960) for the Architectural Forum, was Professor of Architecture and Design (1948-1960) at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, was editor of the publications Plus and Progressive Architecture, wrote two books on the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, edited Le Corbusier, Architect, Painter, Writer (1948), and authored many articles, book reviews, and works of poetry.</p>  </bioghist>
