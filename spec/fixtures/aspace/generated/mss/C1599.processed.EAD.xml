    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Celebrated 20th-century French poet René Char (1907-1988) published more than 30 volumes of poetry, criticism, and plays during his lifetime, many of which were widely translated. He frequently collaborated with both writers and artists, including Georges Braque, Joan Miró, and Nicolas de Staël. He was also decorated military veteran, receiving recognition for his service in the French army and his involvement with the French Resistance during World War II.</p><p> In the early 1930s, Char was active in the surrealist movement, joining a community of writers and artists that included Louis Aragon, André Breton, and Pablo Picasso. From 1939 to 1940, he served as a private with the 173e RA (Régiment d'Artillerie) in Alsace for which he was awarded the Croix de Guerre. During the Nazi Occupation, Char and his first wife Georgette, who were under surveillance, took refuge in the town of Céreste. It was there, in 1941, when Char began his involvement with the Resistance. By 1943, under the nom de guerre Captain Richard Alexandre, he became the commander of landing operations and parachute drops in the Basses-Alpes (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence) as head of Section Atterrissage Parachutage (SAP) Region 2. Char was awarded the Medal of the Resistance and also named to the Legion of Honor for his service. His prose poem collection Feuillets d'Hypnos documents his wartime experiences.</p><p> After the war, Char moved to the Luberon Mountains of southern France, near his birthplace. In his later years, he was involved with anti-nuclear activism.</p>  </bioghist>
