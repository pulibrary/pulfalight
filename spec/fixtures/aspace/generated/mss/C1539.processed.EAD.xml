    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This is an open collection of photographs by Norwegian-born photographer, essayist, and lecturer Frederick I. Monsen (1865-1929). Born in Bergen, Norway, Monsen emigrated to Utah Territory with his parents in 1868. Monsen learned photography as a teenager, when he and his father worked as a photographic team for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. He began photographing Indians while working for the U.S. Geological Survey in the late 1880s; and took a specific interest in the Native American communities of the Southwest, which he continued to document from the mid-1880s until his death in Pasadena in 1929.</p><p> The photographs in this collection primarily depict Hopi and Navajo people, structures, and landscapes in New Mexico and Arizona. Represented to a lesser extent are Paiute, Apache, Pueblo, and Mojave Indians. There are several views of Indian children, shown with and without clothes, in their daily activities. It consists of a portfolio, entitled "The Frederick Monsen Ethnogoraphic Indian Photographs," dating from circa 1890 to 1910, with twenty-five sepia-toned silver prints (approximately 16″ x 20″ in size) as well as 4 loose silver prints of varying size, dating circa 1905 to 1910.</p>  </scopecontent>
