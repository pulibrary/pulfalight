    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Lorain, Ohio in 1931. She attended Howard University, graduating in 1953 with a degree in English, then received an MA in literature from Cornell University in 1955.</p><p> After a brief teaching stint at Texas Southern University, Morrison returned to teach at Howard in 1957. There, she married architect Harold Morrison, with whom she had two sons, Harold Ford Morrison (born 1961) and Slade Kevin Morrison (1964-2010). The two divorced around the time of Slade's birth, after which Morrison began working as a textbook editor for a division of Random House based in Syracuse, NY. In 1967, Morrison was promoted to senior editor and moved to New York City, where she worked with a number of emerging influential African-American writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Angela Davis, Henry Dumas, and Gayl Jones, in addition to editing The Black Book (1974), a compilation of African-American historical documents.</p><p> Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. She has published a total of eleven novels to date, winning numerous literary and cultural awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Beloved in 1988, the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, the National Humanities Medal in 2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. In addition to her novels, Morrison has written non-fiction, poetry, children's literature (in collaboration with her son Slade), and dramatic works.</p><p> In 1983, she left her position at Random House to concentrate on writing and teaching, serving as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at SUNY Albany from 1984-1989, then the Robert E. Goheen Professor in the Council of the Humanities at Princeton University until her retirement in 2006. During this time, she taught classes in creative writing, African-American studies, and, at Princeton, developed the interdisciplinary Atelier program. She has also served as a visiting professor and lecturer at numerous institutions, including Yale University, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University.</p><p> Morrison lived in Grand View-on-Hudson in New York until her death in 2019 at age 88.</p>  </bioghist>

following the original grouping of material.

The Additional Working Files subseries includes additional materials received after the bulk of the papers were arranged.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_da3acfc03a130922f3e29f7e8ec9960b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of files maintained by Morrison and her administrative assistants, including Ronaline Saunders, Rene Boatman, and John Hoppenthaler. The first subseries of files concern Morrison's book and writings projects, and include correspondence with editors, publishers, and translators, as well as publicity tour schedules and related material. The office files, maintained at Morrison's offices at SUNY Albany and later Princeton University, document Morrison's activities, including awards, conferences, lectures, interviews, etc., throughout her career as a public figure. The office files also include subject files pertaining to her publishers, literary agency, various professional organizations, and individuals; letterbooks of administrative correspondence sent by Morrison and her assistants, various requests received, and fan mail. The files from Morrison's home office are similar in content to the office working files, but are the primary location of book contracts and royalty statements.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_C1491_c1903" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Book and Project Working Files</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">9 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1955-01-01/2014-12-31" type="inclusive">1955-2014</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e396ce9c041d78dba8bfa9814eddf721"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes correspondence with editors, publishers, and contributors; publicity tour information; translations and screenplay adaptations related to Morrison's books.

The disks in groups "DataBase Files, Indexes and Programs" and "Ronnie's Disks" were maintained as per their original arrangement, in boxes with those labels.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_065fc2c204223d477999b4ebfc80d265"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of files extracted from 3.5" and 5.25" floppy disks. These files include drafts from Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Playing in the Dark, Race-ing Justice, Engendering Power, Birth of a Nation'Hood, and various academic lectures; as well as administrative databases and correspondence, likely including duplicates from letterbooks and reports found in Working Files.</p><p> Researchers should note that partial drafts of Beloved can be found in file groups "DataBase Files, Indexes and Programs" and "Ronnie's Disks."</p><p>  Disk titles are taken from original handwritten labels, and may include dates that do not match the dates derived from the actual files. When disks were unlabeled, disk titles were occasionally supplied by the archivist, as indicated at the file-level. Description notes for individual disks contain further notations from longer labels or disk envelopes where present, or other contextual information. Disk numbers refer to the order in which disk imaging was attempted. Some disks (disk009, disk027, disk030-disk031, disk054, disk076, disk104-disk110, disk112-disk119) were unable to be successfully imaged but may be added if new machines allow them to be imaged successfully.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_C1491_c4216" level="file"><did><unittitle>Access Test File</unittitle><unitid>disk056</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 digital file</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 box</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000-11-09/2000-11-09" type="inclusive">2000 November 09</unitdate><container altrender="hsvm" id="aspace_3f33acfcd0b7bffb3f7a012e58c943fe" label="mixed materials [32101086131362]" type="box">228</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_792e4fcdaa8c4fb153029fc7755724b6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>R.BOATMAN x1071 boatman@princeton.edu</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1491_c5511" level="file"><did><unittitle>BACKUP ARCHIVE 1990</unittitle><unitid>disk012</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 digital files</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 box</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1991-01-23/1992-02-27" type="inclusive">1991 January 23-1992 February 27</unitdate><container altrender="hsvm" id="aspace_a7b1823960205f376eb3c43bbefb0d9e" label="mixed materials [32101086131354]" type="box">227</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd04923c627192927ffdbc4af6661bd5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>a: / mail 90 / calls 90 12/7/90 1/23/91</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1491_c4217" level="file"><did><unittitle>Beloved</unittitle><unitid>disk016</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">3 digital files</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 box</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1998-11-06/1998-11-06" type="inclusive">1998 November 06</unitdate><container altrender="hsvm" id="aspace_85639852397de9b4ca32b641d2e62384" label="mixed materials [32101086131354]" type="box">227</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_97178909d6e13e5b424a0c442a1e2592"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>for Rene's computer then load new/revised bibliography on to disk + return to E</p><p> These files do not include drafts of Beloved.
