    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Maria Edgeworth was an Anglo-Irish author of adults' and children's literature. Born in Oxfordshire, Maria spent most of her childhood in England. After her mother, Anna Maria Edgeworth (n√©e Elers)'s death, she went to live with her father, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, at his estate in County Longford, Ireland. The time she spent in Ireland was impactful, and this was reflected in her writing celebrating Irish culture and its rejection of English steretypes of Ireland.  

She is considered one of the first realists in children's literature, and her writing played a significant role in the evolution of the novel in Europe at the time. She also wrote about her views on various topics including economis, politics, estate management, and education, and was well regarded in English literary society. She died in 1849 at Edgeworthstown in Ireland.</p>  </bioghist>
