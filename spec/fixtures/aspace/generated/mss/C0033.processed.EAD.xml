    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of several small groups of papers regarding slavery, the American Civil War, and related legal matters in New Orleans, Louisiana, primarily in the 19th century. Assembled by collector Felix Limongi, many of the papers originate from the law firm Durant &amp; Hornor during the time it was based on Carondelet Street in New Orleans. The collection sheds light on black families and black familial slaveholding in 19th century Louisiana, as well as on Reconstruction-era legal cases over property seized by the Union Army during the Civil War.</p><p> One group of papers (1805-1864) consists of the estate records of Marie Claire Chabert (1769-1847), an African American woman who was born into slavery, purchased and manumitted by Jacques Tisserand (a free black man who was formerly enslaved on the same plantation), and lived as a free black woman ("négresse libre") who owned property in the Faubourg Ste. Marie neighborhood of New Orleans from the 1810s to the 1840s. The records, which include deeds of manumission, bills of sale, purchase and tax receipts, wills, and other legal and financial documents, pertain to Chabert's own manumission, her activities managing the estate of Tisserand which he bequeathed to her, her acquisition of land, and her efforts to purchase and manumit her own family members, including several nieces and her husband Michel Bouligny.</p><p> Durant &amp; Hornor papers (1854-1872) consist of correspondence and documents of Philadelphia-born attorneys Thomas Jefferson Durant (1817-1882) and Charles West Hornor (1813-1905) that date to the early Reconstruction period. Most of this material regards various Civil War claims and cases of civilians against the Union Army to recover property or receive damages. Of note is a group of correspondence pertaining to a case brought by James Cosgrove against Benjamin F. Butler (1818-1893) over the seizure of property from his store.</p><p> There are also some miscellaneous correspondence and documents about early Louisiana history collected by Limonge, including letters from William C. C. Claiborne (1775-1817), Edmund Pendleton Gaines (1777–1849), Henry Clay (1777-1852), and Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885), as well as manuscripts by Charles René Bougués (1722) and General V. Beaufort (1802), broadsides, and printed documents reporting on events in Louisiana.</p><p> This collection was formerly referred to as the "Louisiana Slavery and Civil War Collection."</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Mr. Gest acquired the collection from Felix Limongi. Limongi acquired many of the papers from the offices of the New Orleans law firm Durant &amp; Hornor, though he may have added some material from other sources. A note left by Limongi states that he came across the Marie Claire Chabert records sometime before March 1926 while collecting postage stamps, though it is unclear from available documentation if he also acquired them via Durant &amp; Hornor.</p>  </custodhist>

The earliest materials consist of records of Jacques Tisserand documenting his purchase and manumission of Chabert, as well as her management of his estate, which he bequeathed to her. Documents related to Chabert's own property in New Orleans include an act of sale and survey of two lots of land she purchased from Joseph Bocage in 1810, a certificate regarding a sidewalk survey conducted in 1841, as well as her tax receipts from 1811 to 1845. There are also a number of legal records, including bills of sale, manumission papers, and wills documenting her efforts to purchase and manumit her own family members, including several nieces (Marie Jeanne, Martine, Adélaïde, and Louise), a woman named Rosalie, and Michel Bouligny, a man whom she later married. There are also bills for funeral expenses Chabert paid following the deaths of Rosalie and her husband. The two separate versions of Chabert's will present in the collection document her efforts to manumit and bequeath her property to her remaining family members while navigating legal prohibitions on enslaved persons' ability to inherit.</p><p> There is also a narrative account of Chabert's life and description of the papers, which was written and inserted later by collector Felix Limongi.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_cbe3a2ffeef5cee411cebc89d73f7e86"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Limongi's account is followed by papers of Marie Claire Chabert arranged chronologically.

Born into slavery in 1769 to parents named Stanislas and Marie-Louise, Chabert was enslaved by the family of Don Bartolomeo Le Breton. Jacques (Santiago) Tisserand, a free black carpenter who was formerly enslaved on the same plantation as Chabert, purchased her when she was 26 years old. Tisserand manumitted Chabert upon his death in 1808 and bequeathed to her his estate with the stipulation that she give 200 dollars to his daughter, Manon, who was then enslaved to his sister, Constance Tisserand. After settling Tisserand's estate, Chabert invested in real estate in New Orleans, purchasing property in the Faubourg Ste. Marie neighborhood. She also began purchasing her own enslaved family members, including at least four nieces as well as a man named Michel Bouligny, whom she later manumitted and married. Following her marriage to Michel Bouligny (who died in 1836), Chabert was sometimes referred to in documents as Madame Veuve Michel Bouligney née Le Breton or Madame Veuve Michel. Her own wills refer to her as Marie Claire Chabert, which is presumably the name she chose for herself. Chabert died at her home in New Orleans in 1847 at the age of 78. She left a will requiring her executor to free the nieces who were enslaved to her, bequeathing to them her estate and ordering them to purchase and manumit another niece.</p></bioghist></c></dsc>
