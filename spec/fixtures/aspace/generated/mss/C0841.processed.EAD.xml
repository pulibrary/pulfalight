    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Noël Riley Fitch was born on December 24, 1937, in New Haven, Connecticut, and educated
            at Northwest Nazarene College (B.A. 1959) and Washington State University (M.A. 1965 and
            Ph.D. 1969). She was a professor of literature from 1971 to1987, and chair of the
            department of literature and modern languages from 1982 to 1985 at Point Loma College.
            Currently Fitch lectures at both the University of Southern California and the American
            University of Paris. She has written several biographies of influential women and is a
            frequent contributor of articles to journals and periodicals. Most of Fitch's writings
            reflect her fascination with American expatriate writers in Paris in the 1920s and
            1930s, and include the following: Sylvia Beach and the Lost
               Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties and Thirties(1983),
               Literary Cafés of Paris(1989), Walks in Hemingway's Paris: A Guide for the Literary Traveler(1990), and
               Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin(1993). Her most
            recent work is Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia
               Child(1997).</p>  </bioghist>
