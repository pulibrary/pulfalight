Born in Tientsin, China, in 1938, Ruas studied French, English, and Comparative Literature at Princeton University, where he received a BA in 1960, MA in 1963, and PhD in 1970. Ruas was a Fulbright scholar at the Sorbonne in 1963 and 1964. From 1974 to 1979, Ruas served as the Director of the Drama and Literature Department for New York's Pacifica station WBAI-FM, where he interviewed many famous cultural and literary icons and initiated several innovative literary programs, including the Audio-Experimental Theatre, which fostered collaboration among artists on multimedia projects for radio, and The Reading Experiment, a year-long series of readings from Marguerite Young's novel Miss MacIntosh, My Darling. Ruas also developed radio programming for the Museum of Modern Art's WPS1 Art Radio, served as an editor for Marguerite Young and other writers, published literary and art criticism for The Soho Weekly News, ARTnews, and Art in America, and conducted interviews of writers for The New York Times Book Review and The Paris Review. In 1985, Ruas published Conversations with American Writers, which includes a group of interviews from the early 1980s with several major writers, including Toni Morrison, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Susan Sontag, and others.

Several of the photograph albums were put together by Charles Ruas' grandfather and father who were French engineers in the early Chinese ship-building industry at Dagu (Taku) and the water supply system of Tianjin. The Manchu General Marshal Yin Chang was the father of Charles Ruas's mother, so there are also some rare Chinese photographs of the imperial family.</p><p>Two albums show the beginning of the beginning of the Chinese shipbuilding industry in the early 20th century at the Taku shipyards and colonial life in Tianjin in the 1910s and 1920. They show the Brossard shipyard, images of several ships under construction and the conditions of workers at the shipyards, and the various other shipyards at Taku. Other photographs show important landmarks in the city. Two additional albums show colonial life in Tianjin from the 1920s to 1946. They show historical events such as the famine of 1920-1921, the flood of 1924, the inauguration of the International Bridge, the Japanese attack on Tianjin in 1937, the Japanese Blockade of 1939, the great flood of 1939, the liberation of Tianjin by United States Marines and the history of the Ruas family in Tianjin. Another album, originally belonging to an unidentified American soldier of the 15th United States Infantry which was based in Tianjin, has photographs dating from 1912 to 1940, and includes photographs of Marshall Zhang Zuolin in Tianjin, General William Conner and Prince Chun, father of emperor Pu Yi, with his entourage. Other photos show city life and religious ceremonies.</p><p>There are also a small number of rare photographs of the Qing imperial family illustrating the early interaction of the Qing court with Westerners. These include for example a photograph of Emperor Pu Yi against a painted automobile prop, taken at the British Country Club in Tianjin as well as a collection of photographs from a collection of glass negatives by Shun Ling, brother of Princess Der Ling, that show landmarks in the Forbidden City. The collection also includes a photographic album entitled 皇室旧影 that shows members of the imperial family. The photographs in this album were likely also taken by Shun Ling.</p><p>Spellings/transliterations on folder titles reflect those found on the materials or the inventory provided by the donor.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_C1372_c47202-68234" level="file"><did><unittitle>Historical Photographs</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/5/archival_objects/1448310</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1912/1919" type="inclusive">circa 1912-1919</unitdate><container altrender="mss" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_59384270980efd09a6a4528ae9e3b62d" label="Mixed Materials [32101103191282]" type="box">B-001565</container><container id="aspace_c8c83feefbd2fe84a8fe9d86b860194e" parent="aspace_59384270980efd09a6a4528ae9e3b62d" type="folder">11</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://figgy.princeton.edu/concern/scanned_resources/1de0a9d2-f5ce-4713-8135-7567828cc532/manifest" xlink:role="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="View digital content" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>View digital content</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e1ab8936adb25b7c934a0a852aafe7b1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes an album titled "Revolution in China," Verlag con Franz Scholz, Tientsin (1912?); 12 photographs of the proclamation of the republic in Beijing; Sun Yat Sen in Shanghai postcard; military encampment photo; the founding of Nankai University postcard (1919); and a photograph of Premier Cho En Lai as a student at Nankai University playing a female role in a student theater production.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_23b142a8778b1d1380565cdb499b5013"><head>Content Warning</head><p>The "Revolution in China" album contains photographs of dead bodies.</p></scopecontent></c></c></dsc>
