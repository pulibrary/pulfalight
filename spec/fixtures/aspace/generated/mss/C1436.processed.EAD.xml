    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of black-and-white photographic prints, working files, and correspondence of Marc Gaede, including materials created in collaboration with Marnie Walker Gaede and Robert Sundance, largely related to book projects between the mid 1970s and the late 1990s. Photographic materials include over 250 mounted prints of landscapes and portraits that appeared in photography books published under the Gaedes' Chaco Press, which include Images from the Southwest (1986), Bordertowns (1988), and Images from the Great West (1990), as well as several portraits of friends and family and other images. Working files exist for the same books as well as for Camera, Spade and Pen (1980), The Hopi Photographs (1988), and other published works on archaeology and conservation. These files are comprised of correspondence, publishing contracts and agreements, drafts, image lists, publicity materials, legal and financial documents, sound recordings, and other related materials.</p><p> A large portion of the collection consists of working files for Sundance: The Robert Sundance Story (1994), a biography of Lakota Sioux activist Robert Sundance written collaboratively by Sundance and Marc Gaede and edited by Marnie Gaede. The book tells the story of Sundance's struggle with and recovery from alcoholism, his famous court battle against the city and county of Los Angeles to improve the treatment of alcoholics on Skid Row, and his later work as an American Indian rights activist. Working files for this project include sound recordings and transcriptions of Sundance's oral narration, drafts of chapters and the full book in both paper and digital form, as well as publishing correspondence, agreements, and related documents. Also present are extensive research, legal, and publicity files Sundance kept regarding his legal case and other cases involving tribal sovereignty and American Indian rights, as well as personal writings, family documents, photographs, and correspondence of Sundance provided to Gaede as source material.</p><p> A small amount of additional correspondence pertains to publishing, as well as to courses Gaede taught on environmentalism, participation in the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and other professional activities.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Marc Gaede (1946- ) is an American photographer, environmental activist, and teacher. Born in Tuscon, Arizona, Gaede grew up in Flagstaff, where he immersed himself in the study of field geology, archaeology, and physical anthropology. After returning in 1968 from military service as a U.S. Marine Corps photographer, Gaede became involved in environmental activism. In 1970, he co-founded the early direct action environmental group Black Mesa Defense Fund. In collaboration with members of the American Indian Movement and Edward Abbey (1927-1989), the group organized a direct action campaign against strip mining on shared Navajo and Hopi land on Black Mesa in April 1971. The group's actions inspired Abbey's 1975 novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, along with the next generation of radical environmental advocacy groups, such as Earth First!, who practiced a form of ecological sabotage against environmentally damaging companies and individuals that came to be known as "monkeywrenching." Gaede received his Bachelor of Science degree in anthropology from Northern Arizona University in 1972, and he worked at the at the Museum of Northern Arizona from 1968 to 1977, first as a staff photographer and later as curator of photography. For five months in 1977, he worked for photographer Ansel Adams as a temporary darkroom assistant in Adams's darkroom and studio in Carmel, California. Later he was the Photographer-in-Residence at the University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography in 1978-1979.</p><p> In 1973, Marc Gaede married Marnie Walker Gaede, a writer, editor, publisher, and environmentalist who collaborated with him to edit and publish photography books centering on indigenous cultures and landscapes of the American West and Southwest, many under their own publishing imprint Chaco Press. The Gaedes moved to the Los Angeles area in 1982, where they worked in the television and film industry, including as script analysts for the Walt Disney Company. Gaede received a Master of Fine Arts in photography from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1988, where he has since worked as an instructor in subjects including photography, environmental issues, and physical anthropology. Since 1989, the Gaedes have also been actively involved with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Marc Gaede joined Sea Shepherd on a 1989 dolphin campaign in Costa Rica as a photographer for Outside magazine and has since photographed numerous high seas campaigns. From 1990 to 1993, the Gaedes worked closely with Robert Sundance, a Lakota Sioux activist from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, to collaboratively write Sundance's biography.</p>  </bioghist>

Marc Gaede and Robert Sundance first met in 1986 after Sundance spoke out in defense of Gaede's controversial book Bordertowns, which depicted alcoholism in Native American communities. In 1990, Sundance and the Gaedes agreed to collaborate on Sundance's biography, which they worked on from 1990 to 1993, with Marc Gaede composing the text of the biography from recordings of Sundance telling his story and Marnie Gaede providing editorial guidance. Fifty-four audiocassette tapes containing recordings of Sundance's oral history are present, as well as transcriptions, drafts of the biography in both paper and digital form, and administrative correspondence regarding publishing and editorial matters. There is also a significant group of legal research files compiled and annotated by Sundance during the 1970s and 1980s, which include court documents, clippings, and publicity materials regarding his case, as well as other American Indian rights issues. A smaller group of personal and family papers of Robert Sundance includes other writings by him, correspondence, personal documents, and family and childhood photographs.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_8b97285c1a453e615272f70af4392944"><note label="personal-name">Sundance, Robert, 1927-1993</note><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Robert Sundance was a Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux activist who was born Rupert Sibley McLaughlin in March 1927 in Wakpala, South Dakota, on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Sundance struggled with alcoholism from a young age. After serving in the United States Navy and Air Force from 1943 to 1950, he lived itinerantly across the American West for the next several decades, often homeless and incarcerated hundreds of times for public drunkenness. When in the 1960s he found himself being routinely arrested on Skid Row in Los Angeles, he began a legal self-education program using resources he found in jail libraries. By the early 1970s he was writing dozens of petitions to the courts, largely writs of habeas corpus arguing that it was unconstitutional for the police to arrest people simply for suffering from the disease of alcoholism and for being too impoverished to have a place to live. When one of his petitions eventually reached the Center for Law in the Public Interest, a young lawyer named Timothy McFlynn agreed to take on Sundance's case.</p><p> In 1975, Sundance sued the city and county of Los Angeles to demand better treatment of alcoholics arrested for public inebriation. Sundance v. Los Angeles Municipal Court was the beginning of a two-decade legal battle known as the "Sundance Case," in which a judge ruled in 1978 that improvements must be made to ensure the constitutional rights of those arrested for public drunkenness. Sundance appealed to the Second District Court of Appeal in 1981 and the California Supreme Court in 1987 with the aim of decriminalizing public drunkenness entirely; while these appeals were ultimately unsuccessful, and the United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case, Sundance's legal battle led to a dramatic decrease in arrests in Los Angeles and an increase in treatment options for homeless people struggling with alcoholism. His activism played a major role in popularizing the perception of alcoholism as a disease and public health issue rather than a crime, as well as in increasing treatment-based alternatives to incarceration for alcoholics in the Los Angeles area and beyond. After entering into recovery himself, Sundance became the executive director of the Indian Alcoholism Commission of California in 1979, lobbying to improve alcoholism treatment programs in Los Angeles County, with a focus on how alcoholism affected indigenous communities.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_C1436_c284" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sundance Book Interviews and Drafts</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">7 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1991-01-01/1995-12-31" type="inclusive">1991-1995</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_8d4e622558faa810720ef20692620e64"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged to reflect the process of composition.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_47c6fdcd24eb94dc3b36aa92622c2dcd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These materials document from start to end the composition of Robert Sundance's biography, which was written as a collaborative effort of Robert Sundance and Marc Gaede.
