    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Consists of a closed collection of documents related to slavery, the trade of enslaved persons, and the colonial plantation economy, particularly in the United States, the Caribbean, and Brazil in the 18th and 19th centuries. This miscellaneous collection provides a way of locating small accessions of slavery-related material acquired by the Library from various sources.</p><p> The majority of the collection consists of bills of sale, plantation inventories, and other records created by European colonists documenting the sale and valuation of enslaved men, women, and children in the United States, including New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Louisiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi; the Three Mile River Estate in Westmoreland, Jamaica; the Mount Charles (Middleton) Plantation in Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica, which was owned by Sir Henry Clinton (1738?-1795); and the plantation estate of John Lavicount in Antigua. Also present is a document containing statistics on enslaved populations for each state copied from the United States Census of 1790, as well as a 1820 deed of freedom for a formerly enslaved man in Brazil.</p><p> There are also several indentures for domestic apprenticeship or enslavement of African American and multiracial children in Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, which date from the 1790s through the 1820s, including for two children apprenticed to United States Representative Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763-1845) of New York.</p><p> Materials related to ships involved in the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans include a price list taken from the log of the English merchant ship Daniel and Henry, which was employed along the Gold Coast of West Africa (1700); an account book for the French privateer ship Républicaine (1798-1799); and a sales agreement and invoice for the cargo of the American ship Favourite (1804).</p><p> Additional letters and documents pertain to efforts to extend slavery throughout the Americas, including copied documents regarding the status of enslaved and free people of color following the British capture of Martinique from French colonial rule in 1794; a letter between French generals working to suppress revolutionary efforts during the Haitian Revolution; and a letter between United States politicians regarding congressional debates over the expansion of slavery into the California and New Mexico territories in the late 1840s.</p><p> The Documents on Slavery in Brazil file group consists of 77 miscellaneous legal and other documents, as well as one book, dating from 1758 to 1888, pertaining to the history of the history of slavery in Brazil as a Portuguese colony and later as the Empire of Brazil, until the abolition of slavery in 1887. Titles and description are transcribed exactly as they are on the dealer's inventory received with the materials. The folder numbers correspond with the item number in the dealer's inventory.</p><p> This collection was formerly referred to as the "Miscellaneous Slavery Collection." No additions will be made to this collection. Accessions relating to this topic will be added to the General Manuscripts Miscellaneous Collection (C0140).</p>  </scopecontent>

The sale included the Mount Charles Plantation (later known as the Middleton Plantation), as well as another parcel of land known as "Middleton Penn," 247 enslaved laborers (all of whom are listed by name and occupation), and all future children born to the enslaved women listed.</p><p> The indenture first recites a deed dated September 24, 1768, which was the original document of sale between Charles Pole (seller) and Augustin Gwyn (purchaser). Gwyn, still owing money for the original purchase, sold shares in the ownership of the plantation in order to pay off his debt to Pole. Investors, named as the third party, who paid varying sums directly to Pole, include Simon Fanshawe of Hanover Square, Lewis Vickers of Holyhead, Patty Parsons of Hanover Square, Dorothy Askew of Wakefield, and numerous others. The document then records the sale of the estate by Gwyn to the fourth party, named as General Henry Clinton of Weybridge, and Matthew Brickdale of Clifton. The fifth and sixth named parties are listed as Charles Fanshawe of Inner Temple, William Bond of Walbrook, and Thomas and Clayton Case, who were Liverpool merchants and owners of slave ships. Charles Pole, 1695-1779, fifth son of Samuel Pole of Redbourne Hall, was a Liverpool merchant and Member of Parliament. Matthew Brickdale, 1735-1831, was a Bristol clothier, undertaker, and Member of Parliament who reportedly inherited £100,000 after the death of his father; he also owned the Hope Estate in St. Vincent and another plantation on Nevis. In 1832, prior to the abolition of slavery by the British in 1833, 61 enslaved women and 47 enslaved men were held in bondage on the Middleton Plantation.</p></scopecontent><acqinfo id="aspace_cbc13fbf695064d39eaeb6bc9f78c6ce"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>AM 2018-54</p><p> Purchased in <date normal="2017-12" type="acquisition">December 2017</date>.</p></acqinfo></c><c id="aspace_C1210_c002" level="item"><did><unittitle>Copy of Statistics on Enslaved Population from 1790 United States Census</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1790/1790" type="inclusive">1790</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="mss" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_a0f94061d5300dd195b1d32655b74db9" label="Mixed Materials [32101037662275]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_feb191bf18b28b3d42e2ee1c689d5bdc" parent="aspace_a0f94061d5300dd195b1d32655b74db9" type="folder">2</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_514119f3a10ba2cbf8bcc79de634d360"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a1a666d3f58c4d41f254cf316f6a3f84"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Consists of a 15-page manuscript copy (possibly made in 1830) of the first American census conducted in 1790, with statistics about the number of enslaved persons in each state, broken down by county.
