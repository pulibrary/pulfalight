    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Ricardo Emilio Piglia Renzi was an Argentine author, critic, and screenwriter. He was professor emeritus of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures and the Walter S. Carpenter Professor of Language, Literature and Civilization of Spain at Princeton University. He was born on November 24, 1941, in Adrogué, a province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1955, his family moved to Mar del Plata where he studied history at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. He left for Buenos Aires to begin work in literary editorials in 1965. In 1967 he published his first book La invasión, which later received the Casa de las Américas prize. In 1975 he published his first volume of essays Nombre falso which includes an homage to Roberto Arlt (Homenaje a Roberto Arlt). Piglia's literary criticism centers around the themes of the Argentine novel, genre, fiction, translation, Argentine political history, and the works of various writers such as Roberto Arlt, Jorge Luis Borges, Macedonio Fernández, Leopoldo Lugones, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Horacio Quiroga. Piglia's essays and novels — which include Respiración artificial (1980) and Blanco nocturno (2010) — have been translated into English, French, Italian, German and Portuguese. Several of his novels, including Plata quemada (1997) were adapted as films. His novel La ciudad ausente (1992) was adapted as an opera and premiered in the Teatro Colón in 1995. He also wrote several screenplays including Foolish Heart (1998), Plata quemada (2000), and El astillero (1999). Piglia kept a journal for most of his life and published various autobiographical volumes under the name of his alter ego, Emilio Renzi: Los años de formación (1957-1967) in 2015; Los años felices (1968-1975), in 2016; and Un día en la vida, in 2017. He taught at the Universidad de Buenos Aires from 1990 to 2000. Prior to joining Princeton's faculty he taught at the University of California at San Diego, University of California at Davis, and Harvard University. He first arrived to Princeton as a visiting fellow in the Humanities Council in 1986-1987; and was a frequent visiting professor prior to joining the Princeton University faculty in 2001. During his teaching career at Princeton he taught courses on Argentine literature, the detective genre, Jorge Luis Borges, Macedonio Fernández, Juan José Saer, and Rodolfo Walsh. He retired from Princeton in 2011. Piglia received numerous awards, including the Premio Casa de las Américas (1967), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1989), Premio Planeta (1997), Premio internacional de novela Rómulo Gallegos (2011), and Premio Iberoamericano de las Letras (2005), the Premio Iberoamericano de Letras José Donoso (2005). In 2014 he won the Diamond Konex Award. He died in Buenos Aires on January 6, 2017 at the age of 75.</p>  </bioghist>
