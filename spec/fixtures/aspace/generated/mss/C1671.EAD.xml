<p>
Consists of twelve mostly unpublished manuscripts from Renaissance scholar, Muzio Pansa, in fifteen volumes. Some of the manuscripts are from when Pansa was a student at the Jesuit Collegio Romano, where he was a contemporary of Galileo. Both students had Paulus Valla (Paulus Vallius) as a lecturer, and several of the lecture notes are copied from his lecture notes. The works in this collection range from fragments to tomes, and range in subject matter as well; in addition to the lecture notes are Pansa's unpublished Latin treatise on pharmacology, his pious Italian tragedy, Il mundo redento (published posthumously), writings on theology, and the De osculo, a significant work in the history of Renaissance Neo-Platonism.</p><p>
Some of the later manuscripts are likely in the hand of his younger son and literary executor, Carlo Muzio.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Muzio (or Mutio; he also went by the pseudonym, Costante) Pansa (1565-1628) was a medical doctor and humanist writer from the Abruzzo region. Born in Penne, in the region of Abruzzo, Italy, he was the son of a merchant. He studied both philosophy and medicine with Cardinal Costanzo Torri da Sarnano in Rome, where he attended the Jesuit Collegio Romano and l'Università la Sapienza. During his schooling, he composed several works, including Poesie Amorose, Adnotationes Alphabeticae ex Universa Medicina Extractae (1587, a dictionary of medicine), La Raffaella (1588, a comedy), and Delle glorie di Sisto Quinto (a verse and prose opera). He lectured at the Accademia degli Aggirati and was rector of Accademia medica detta degli Ardenti. In 1588, he returned to Penne where he practiced medicine, continued his studies, wrote verse, published writings on various public (usually papal) occasions, and initiated and actively participated in various scholarly societies. His most well-known work is Della libraria Vaticana (1590), which describes the newly completed Sistine Vatican Library.</p>  </bioghist>

This manuscript, recording inscriptions of monuments in Roman churches - chiefly ecclesiastical, and often pontifical - probably dates from his earliest years in Rome. The manuscript is numbered in at least two sequences and fragmentary, but with a certain continuity. It appears to be the third section of a much longer work, and seems to be a precursor to Muzio's best known work, Della libreria Vaticana (1590). As they are now ordered, one of the quires, ends with the inscription on the monument to Alessandro Farnese, the Cardinal who funded the construction of the Church of the Gesù, and is followed by that of Ignatius of Loyala.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1671_c25087-73366" level="item"><did><unittitle>Tractatus Rerum Metaphysicarum de anima in comuni et de vegetativa in specie, Tomus IIII</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/5/archival_objects/1455252</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 item</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1587/1588" type="inclusive">1587-1588</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_8f20a0517e3236c5ac115f3144aa0a98">Materials are in Latin.</langmaterial><container altrender="scamss" encodinganalog="Standard records center" id="aspace_ce43d8957aceab604a21ff45f2d88533" label="Mixed Materials [32101078586375]" type="box">B-002008</container><container id="aspace_9ee11ab813d72ef8d3712b598b3ea9c6" parent="aspace_ce43d8957aceab604a21ff45f2d88533" type="item">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b92d80de92a54c7be74874bd025f9a0d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>An example of sixteenth-century lecture notes as copied by Mutio Pansa.

Pansa often would record his authorship, or ownership, so it is possible that it is a later set of notes by Carlo Muzio.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1671_c02602-47146" level="item"><did><unittitle>[Pharmaciae]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/5/archival_objects/1455255</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 item</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1593-07-10/1593-07-10">1593 July 10</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_1cf4e42fdd0db86fc0972815d2fa0ea1">Materials are in Latin.</langmaterial><container altrender="scamss" encodinganalog="Standard records center" id="aspace_9aa8ccd3a9a9d3c5a0932c67354bd2e0" label="Mixed Materials [32101078586375]" type="box">B-002008</container><container id="aspace_b36f944216f4d6f9bd8faef0a73c66a4" parent="aspace_9aa8ccd3a9a9d3c5a0932c67354bd2e0" type="item">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_596850f27f35f82e37ec275034dc8d47"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This manuscript contains two parts, with some incomplete portions.

There are numerous sidenotes, apparently added later, some lengthy ones being additions or amendments to the text, more often the identification of a quotation. There the works Pansa cites are from ancient, medieval, and modern sources, and enough of the 'Arabic school' to justify the assertion made by the scholar, Giovanni de Caesaris, that Pansa's medical thinking was suffused with the Arabic tradition: although there is no Averroes or Avicenna, we do find Geber, 'Haly', and Constaninus Africanus. Among the medieval sources are Kimchi, Henricus de Asia [Hassia], and among the moderns are Cardano, Erasmus, Fernel, Falloppio, Porta, and Huarte.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1671_c88275-08025" level="item"><did><unittitle>Nel Tragico Teatro, Il mundo redento</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/5/archival_objects/1455256</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 item</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1594/1594">1594</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_8a11ec1320cf0591939e755845120798">Materials are in Italian.</langmaterial><container altrender="scamss" encodinganalog="Standard records center" id="aspace_38d79fd3e3a746fd9ec9c08deafaee28" label="Mixed Materials [32101078586375]" type="box">B-002008</container><container id="aspace_ad9ba1fc967f63adfb1f4c3fd707ff11" parent="aspace_38d79fd3e3a746fd9ec9c08deafaee28" type="item">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_454391c40c388c7c88ed3387b1f7e3e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Act V of this manuscript ends in the middle of Scene 3. The play was published posthumously in Venice in 1641, edited by Carlo Muzio Pansa, Muzio Pansa's son. This is a working draft, without the introduction which appeared in the printed version. The corrections seem to be in the author's hand, but some might be in his son's. It is an allegorical work, with the chief characters being The World, Pluto, The Flesh, Death, and Sin, and others including the Virgin Mary, apostles, centurions, Scribes and Pharisees, etc. There are some decorated initials in Pansa's usual style, though a few are only rudimentary.

Consists of four volumes, with two versions of volume two. The shorter of the two versions may be the earlier version, but both appear to be working drafts. The work was published in Chieti in 1601 as "De osculo ethnicae et Christianae philosophiae. Unde Chaldeorum, Aegyptiorum, Persarum, Arabum, Graecorum, &amp; Latinorum mysteria, tamquam ab hebraeis desummpta fidei nostrae consona deducuntur: tomi quatuor," and was reprinted in Marburg in 1605. These four volumes all show Pansa at work: he added more than he cut. The effort has been characterized as 'syncretic neoplatonism'.</p><p>
Pansa works through each of his subject in roughly the same order, starting with Zoroaster (who gets a large portion), Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, then on through the Greeks to 'Omnes phylosophi', a portmanteau term for 'the rest of the world', including assorted Sybils, Rabbis, Arabs (especially Avicenna and 'Avenrhois' [Averroes], and Druids. The endeavour owes much to Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, both of whom are often referenced in the work.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_C1671_c76487-93557" level="item"><did><unittitle>Caput.
