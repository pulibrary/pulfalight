    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning Records document the activities of Physical Planning, one division of Princeton University's Department of Facilities, and are primarily related to the construction and modification of buildings and other structures on Princeton's campus. The records contain a variety of documents, including correspondence between Physical Planning and contractors/designers, interoffice memoranda describing potential projects, invoices for work completed, and studies and reports pertaining to the campus. Additionally, as the Office of Physical Planning was at one point the central repository for all architectural drawings and maps of campus, this type of material (in oversized and microform formats) constitutes a significant portion of the records.</p><p> Please see series descriptions in contents list for additional information about individual series.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning is one of several branches that together comprise the University's Department of Facilities. Working in conjunction with the Office of the University Architect, the Office of Physical Planning coordinates and participates in architectural developments; manages construction of major new structures and alterations to existing structures; and oversees interior design and furniture planning. In February 2000 the Office of Physical Planning initiated a project to restore the 27 stained glass windows of the University chapel and some of the exterior sculptures. It was the largest stained glass restoration effort attempted in the United States in a quarter century and the first at the University Chapel since it was built in 1928. The stained glass restoration project was completed in December 2001, and was awarded a Historic Preservation Award by the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office.</p>  </bioghist>
