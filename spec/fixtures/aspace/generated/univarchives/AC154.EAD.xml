    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning Records document the activities of Physical Planning, one division of Princeton University's Department of Facilities, and are primarily related to the construction and modification of buildings and other structures on Princeton's campus. The records contain a variety of documents, including correspondence between Physical Planning and contractors/designers, interoffice memoranda describing potential projects, invoices for work completed, and studies and reports pertaining to the campus. Additionally, as the Office of Physical Planning was at one point the central repository for all architectural drawings and maps of campus, this type of material (in oversized and microform formats) constitutes a significant portion of the records.</p><p> Please see series descriptions in contents list for additional information about individual series.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The Office of Physical Planning Records were transferred to the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library in several accessions. The files which comprise Series 1: Building Project Records were transferred between 1996 and 2002, Series 2: Architectural Drawings (Microform) were transferred in 1986, and the bulk of the documents which comprise Series 3: Architectural Drawings (Oversized) were transferred to the library between 1972 and 1980. An small selection of maps were acquired in 2017 and added to Series 3.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning is one of several branches that together comprise the University's Department of Facilities. Working in conjunction with the Office of the University Architect, the Office of Physical Planning coordinates and participates in architectural developments; manages construction of major new structures and alterations to existing structures; and oversees interior design and furniture planning. In February 2000 the Office of Physical Planning initiated a project to restore the 27 stained glass windows of the University chapel and some of the exterior sculptures. It was the largest stained glass restoration effort attempted in the United States in a quarter century and the first at the University Chapel since it was built in 1928. The stained glass restoration project was completed in December 2001, and was awarded a Historic Preservation Award by the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office.</p>  </bioghist>

For the most part, each group of cards represents one building or landscape feature, a related group of buildings, or drawings of a similar type, e.g., "Planting, Parking and Plazas" or "Sanitary Sewerage System." The parenthetical notes next to each title are a shorthand system of identifi employed by the Office of Physical Planning. Though the number of images varies from building to building, there exists a basic floor plan and elevation for each structure. Notably absent from this set of plans is any depiction of Nassau Hall.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_4bdd4bec783bbc6187e9dc5c8ec7cead"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by name of structure or subject.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_AC154_c02456" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alexander Hall (ALEX)</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1900" type="inclusive">1900</unitdate><container altrender="review" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_e17a054c0252941b8d41fc77cc6b9929" label="Mixed Materials [AC154_n92]" type="box">87</container><container id="aspace_0526b257235ebf778e94e469b3d96a73" parent="aspace_e17a054c0252941b8d41fc77cc6b9929" type="folder">1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_defef7a08c1ce9f8ca0dbd564d6e6b2f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>All architectural drawings transferred by the Office of Physical Planning to the University Archives are open for research use.
