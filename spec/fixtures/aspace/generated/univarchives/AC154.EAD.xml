<p>The Office of Physical Planning Records document the activities of Physical Planning, one division of Princeton University's Department of Facilities, and are primarily related to the construction and modification of buildings and other structures on Princeton's campus. The records contain a variety of documents, including correspondence between Physical Planning and contractors/designers, interoffice memoranda describing potential projects, invoices for work completed, and studies and reports pertaining to the campus. Additionally, as the Office of Physical Planning was at one point the central repository for all architectural drawings and maps of campus, this type of material (in oversized and microform formats) constitutes a significant portion of the records.</p><p> Please see series descriptions in contents list for additional information about individual series.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of Physical Planning was the division of Princeton University's Department of Facilities charged with oversight of the construction of new buildings on campus and alterations to existing structures. The primary responsibility of Physical Planning was the management of construction of major structures and alterations to existing structures on the Princeton campus. Physical Planning also arranged for interior design, furniture planning, and landscape design in and around campus buildings. Its other duties included providing long-range planning support for campus building projects, particularly in regards to land use and zoning considerations as well as the maintenance of campus graphics including building plans and maps.</p><p> The antecedent to the Office of Physical Planning can be found in the Grounds and Buildings Committee of the Trustees, established in 1876. At the time of its formation the committee appointed a single individual to act as the Curator of Grounds and Buildings, later known as the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings. As the campus grew in size so too did the level of staffing required for its management and maintenance. In 1964 the title of the position was changed accordingly to Manager of the Division of Physical Planning, and once again in 1986 to Director of Physical Planning. These changes in title were often spurred by the frequent arrival of new personnel, and the most singularly consistent figure in the administration of the Office of Physical Planning was Jon D. Hlafter *61, who served as its director from 1969-2004.</p><p> The title of the larger administrative department of which the Office of Physical Planning was a part also changed frequently throughout the University's history. At various times it was known as Grounds and Buildings; Property and Physical Facilities; Physical Planning and Facilities; and Planning, Plant and Properties. Since 1983, the department has simply been known as the Department of Facilities. Headed by the University Vice-President for Facilities, the Department of Facilities and its subsidiary units are located in the MacMillan Building.</p><p> Jon Hlafter's acceptance of the position of University Architect in 2004 came amid a reorganization of the Department of Facilities which resulted in the end of the Office of Physical Planning as it had been known. The tasks that had been overseen by Physical Planning were distributed among several newly created Facilities divisions, with the Office of Design and Construction being most analogous to the old Physical Planning office.</p>  </bioghist>

For the most part, each group of cards represents one building or landscape feature, a related group of buildings, or drawings of a similar type, e.g., "Planting, Parking and Plazas" or "Sanitary Sewerage System." The parenthetical notes next to each title are a shorthand system of identifi employed by the Office of Physical Planning. Though the number of images varies from building to building, there exists a basic floor plan and elevation for each structure. Notably absent from this set of plans is any depiction of Nassau Hall.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_4bdd4bec783bbc6187e9dc5c8ec7cead"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by name of structure or subject.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_AC154_c02456" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alexander Hall (ALEX)</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1900" type="inclusive">1900</unitdate><container altrender="rcpph" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_1a1811a268607207c5cab5af99c9f933" label="Mixed Materials [AC154_n92]" type="box">87</container><container id="aspace_a551d33f06c90e3a11804fb23790c769" parent="aspace_1a1811a268607207c5cab5af99c9f933" type="folder">1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_defef7a08c1ce9f8ca0dbd564d6e6b2f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>All architectural drawings transferred by the Office of Physical Planning to the University Archives are open for research use.
