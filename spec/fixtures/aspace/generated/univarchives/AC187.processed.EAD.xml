    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged into eighteen series, organized as closely as possible to the original filing system, and a final series comprised of miscellaneous material. Most series contain subseries, each described individually in the description section below. Items in the folders are filed in reverse chronological order unless otherwise noted. The filing system was largely inherited from Bowen's predecessor, Robert F. Goheen '40, and was bequeathed in turn to Bowen's successor, Harold T. Shapiro GS'64. A card index to Bowen's files, maintained by Bowen's secretaries and still usable, can be found as Subseries 18G (boxes 434-450).</p>  </arrangement>

Annual reports to the president by administrative departments, when they were issued, are also filed here. Records of controversial issues involving administrative departments or offices include the debate over sex education at the health services department and the food services strike. The files on the admission office are particularly detailed, including admission policy debates, correspondence with prospective students, and contentious admission cases. Of particular interest among these are the folders on coeducation. Because personal information about specific students is restricted by law, all files on applicants (box 99, folder 3 through box 104, folder 11) are closed for 75 years or until the death of the student.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_06a973bc30731687d62b18ea42e5bd58"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>[RESTRICTED IN PART FOR 75 YEARS]</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_AC187_c00647" level="file"><did><unittitle>Admission</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">10 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970-01-01/1988-12-31" type="inclusive">1970-1988</unitdate></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1953690c8bae66ec833da1e2b6f7aa40"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>[RESTRICTED IN PART FOR 75 YEARS]</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_AC187_c00653" level="file"><did><unittitle>Applicants</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">6 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972-01-01/1987-12-31" type="inclusive">1972-1987</unitdate></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_49ea38f9b5b7fd89b907642654e0cf42"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>[RESTRICTED IN PART FOR 75 YEARS]</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_AC187_c00654" level="file"><did><unittitle>A (by Name)</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">3 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1987" type="inclusive">1972-1987</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_0a10711ca9440cce974314f001683d80" label="Mixed Materials [32101113296394]" type="box">99</container><container id="aspace_c23cc64c84937224b0fe4e9120f3b24f" parent="aspace_0a10711ca9440cce974314f001683d80" type="folder">3-5</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b60c9b01d5c4f40c24dd3b067cae2961"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>[RESTRICTED]</p></accessrestrict></c></c></c></c></c></dsc>
