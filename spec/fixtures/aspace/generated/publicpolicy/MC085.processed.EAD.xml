    <note label="personal-name">Lee, Ivy L. (Ivy Ledbetter), 1877-1934</note>
    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Ivy L. Lee was born in Cedartown, Georgia on July 16, 1877 of Emma Eufaula Ledbetter Lee and the Reverend Dr. James Wideman Lee, a well known Methodist clergyman in the South. Ivy Lee's childhood was spent in Atlanta, Georgia, except for his senior year in high school, spent in St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Emory College in Atlanta for two years and then transferred to Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1898. While at Princeton, Lee was active on the college newspaper and won the Lynde debate prize.</p><p> Lee did post-graduate work at Harvard and Columbia Universities, but due to lack of funds, he entered newspaper work. He was a journalist at the New York American, the New York Times, and the New York World. He preferred to write about business and financial affairs. His first work in public relations came in 1903 as publicity manager for the Citizens' Union. He authored the textbook The Best Administration New York City Ever Had, used in Seth Low's unsuccessful mayoral campaign. Lee then took a press job with the Democratic National Committee.</p><p> Lee and George Parker, press agent for the Democratic National Committee, opened the pioneering public relations firm of Parker and Lee in 1905. Parker provided the connections and Lee the creativity in this venture. In an era of muckraking journalism, Lee saw the benefit public relations work could have for big business, believing that if people were presented with all the facts on both sides of an issue, they would not come down so harshly on business interests. Lee saw his role as interpreting the public to the industrialists and the industrialist to the people. To achieve this end, Lee believed in supplying the newspapers with as much information as possible. His "Declaration of Principles," drafted during the anthracite coal strike in the spring of 1906, explained the guiding precepts of his public relations theory. The main points of the Declaration were to guarantee the accuracy of facts and leave to the discretion of the newspaper editor whether an item was worth printing as news. The aim was to provide news, not advertising.</p><p> Another opportunity to practice Lee's principles came with work for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1906. The railroad had a policy of refusing reporters access to all accident sites and refusing to grant interviews. This policy led to reporters' mistrust of the railroad and in turn mistrust on the part of the general public. Lee immediately opened the lines of communication with frequent updates and arranged for reporters to travel to accident sites. In 1908 Lee joined the Pennsylvania Railroad full time, in charge of their publicity bureau.</p><p> In 1910 Lee and his young family sailed to Europe, where he arranged to open European offices for the investment firm of Harris, Winthrop, and Company. While in London, Lee delivered a series of lectures at the London School of Economics on railroads. On December 1, 1912 he became executive assistant to the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. This position gave Lee the opportunity to help influence policy, not just react to incidents at the railroad. Much of Lee's energy was spent in fighting the public clamor to lower freight rates. In 1914 the president of the railroad lent Lee to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to help counter negative press during strikes at the Colorado Fuel and Oil Company mines.</p><p> Lee's work for Rockefeller led to the acceptance of a position on the personal advisory staff of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. beginning January 1, 1915. About a year later, he ended his employ with the Rockefellers, determined to open an independent publicity firm (see below). During World War I, Lee served as publicity director and later as Assistant to the Chairman of the American Red Cross.</p><p> As the firm prospered, with T. J. Ross taking on more duties as day to day manager during the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lee turned his attention to international concerns. He turned his lifelong interest in Russia into a one-man campaign for recognition of the Soviet Union, believing that commerce and a free flow of ideas with the United States would "kill bolshevism." In 1926 he wrote a letter to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce arguing for recognition of the Soviet Union. Lee's letter eventually made front page headlines. Lee continued through the 1920s to push for United States recognition of the Soviet Union, leading to many false accusations that Lee was in the employ of the Soviet government as a propagandist. Present Day Russia (1928) outlined his observations of the Soviet Union made during a trip in 1927. At the time of Lee's death, he was again embroiled in controversy surrounding his consulting work for I. G. Farben Industries of Germany. Many individuals claimed he was in the employ of the Nazi government. No proof was ever found that this allegation was correct.</p><p> Lee married Cornelia Bartlett Bigelow in 1901. The couple had three children: Alice Lee (Cudlipp) in 1902, James Wideman Lee II in 1906, and Ivy Lee, Jr. in 1909. Ivy Lee died of a brain tumor on November 9, 1934; he was 57 years old.</p><p> Organizational History of Ivy Lee &amp; Associates</p><p> The firm was opened on April 1, 1916 by Ivy Lee. Partners in the firm included W. W. Harris, a newspaper man, and James W. Lee, Jr, Ivy's brother, who had also done publicity work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The firm was originally known as Lee, Harris and Lee. Later the name was changed to Ivy Lee and Associates. The firm took on many prominent clients, among them the Pennsylvania Railroad, John D. Rockefeller, Sr. and Jr., various investment houses, industrial organizations, and philanthropic institutions. T. J. Ross joined the firm in 1919.</p><p> In 1933 the name of the firm was changed to Ivy L. Lee and T. J. Ross. T. J. Ross became a senior partner and the other members of the staff junior partners. The junior partners in 1933 were Burnham Carter, Harcourt Parrish, Joseph Ripley, James W. Lee II, and Ivy L. Lee, Jr. At Ivy Lee's death, T J. Ross became the senior partner. In 1944 Ivy Lee, Jr. withdrew from the firm and opened his own office in San Francisco. In 1961, at James W. Lee II's retirement from the firm, its name was changed to T. J. Ross and Associates, Inc.</p>  </bioghist>

Lee II, Matter Sent Out photos, and Lee's large collection of autographed photographs that graced his office walls. The photos of Lee span the years of 1881 to 1932. Many of the photos are undated but appear to be taken during the 1920s. There are also four photographs Lee took while at Emory University and photos taken at the ceremonies of Ivy Lee Day in Cedartown, Georgia in 1965. The family photographs contain members of the immediate family and one portrait of a Lee family gathering that includes Lee's brothers and sisters. Also included is a folder of photographs taken on the family trip "Seeing America" in the summer of 1926. The German photos taken by James W. Lee II in 1933 and 19434 are of Nazi rallies that were enclosed in letters to his parents.</p><p> During World War II, Ivy Lee &amp; Assoc. sent photos out with the MSO material. Only selected photographs have been saved since most were exact duplicates. The photos generally highlight the war work being done by various clients. Many of the photos feature women on the assembly line and in other areas of work. The Marine Studios photos are publicity pictures of the building of the world's largest aquarium at the time, including pictures of the marine life that inhabited the new tourist attraction in Florida. There are 6 boxes of autographed photographs, arranged alphabetically, once hung on Ivy Lee's office walls.</p><p> The visual materials series includes a newsreel of Ivy Lee titled This Man Speaks for the Great: Ivy Lee Relates an intimate anecdote for a noted client, John D. Rockefeller, Sr. There is also footage of Ivy Lee, Jr. in an interview with Allen Center discussing Ivy Lee, Sr. recorded in the Spring of 1971.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8159665ab6fb9481cc60aa779c3dc7c4"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by type of materials.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC085_c1273" level="file"><did><unittitle>Posters</unittitle><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 boxes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1918-01-01/1943-12-31" type="inclusive">1918-1943</unitdate></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9845a8d3999460e79e20c908b96aaf00" rights-restriction="Open"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Collection is open for research use.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_MC085_c01078" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interborough Rapid Transit</unittitle><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 boxes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1918-01-01/1932-12-31" type="inclusive">1918-1932</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://figgy.princeton.edu/collections/6ff2c854-f102-4a5e-861d-276179a3a5f0/manifest" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="View digital content" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>View digital content</p></daodesc></dao></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_24ecde5c8a43075ba74656535918d6ce" rights-restriction="Open"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Collection is open for research use.</p></accessrestrict></c></c></c></dsc>
