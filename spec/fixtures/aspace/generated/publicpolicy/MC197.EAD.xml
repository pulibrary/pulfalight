    <abstract id="aspace_af379fa80d258350e1360a4d6d5d3566">James A. Baker III served in senior government positions under three United States Presidents and was a central figure in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s. Baker also led presidential campaigns for Presidents Gerald Ford, Reagan and Bush over the course of five consecutive presidential elections from 1976 to 1992. The papers document nearly every stage of Baker's career, including his work on presidential campaigns, his time as White House Chief of Staff for both Reagan and Bush, and his terms as Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan and Secretary of State under Bush.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The James A. Baker III Papers document nearly every aspect of Baker's long career in politics and public service, including his time as White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan, his term as Secretary of State under George H.W. Bush, and his work leading the presidential campaigns of Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush. Little documentation of Baker's time as Chief of Staff to President Bush from August 1992 to January 1993 is present in the papers.</p><p> The collection includes a variety of correspondence, memos, handwritten notes, speech transcripts, video and audio tapes, and other material related to Baker's positions in government and on political campaigns. The collection also includes material documenting Baker's legal career and early political efforts, including a substantial amount of correspondence with future President George H.W. Bush, written between Baker and Bush in the 1960s and 1970s. Substantial documentation of the 1978 Texas Attorney General Campaign, the only time Baker ran for political office himself, also exists.</p><p> Please see individual series descriptions for detailed information about the scope of each series.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Appraisal</head>
<p>Duplicates, material of little evidential or information value, and strictly personal documents have been returned to Secretary Baker. A large volume of newspaper clippings from major American newspapers have also been returned.</p><p> The February 2011 accession originally included four additional series, which were subsequently separated.</p><p> A series of board membership records spanned Baker's pre- and post-Washington career (additionally, some files from his work on the boards of regional organizations during the 1960's and '70s were interspersed throughout his personal financial records). Board participation during his post-Washington career includes work with St. Luke's hospital, Rice University, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the University of Bremen, Electronic Data Systems, Radiant Energy Corporation, and King Ranch. These records encompassed twenty linear feet, were non-unique, and of extremely limited research value.</p><p> A series called soft costs documented accounting within Baker Botts of how to expense Baker's political work using Baker Botts resources was also removed from the collection. The series of two boxes consisted of spreadsheets of phone logs and billing codes, and no material regarding the substance of Baker's political work.</p><p> A series of campaign contributions from Baker's 1978 Attorney General campaign included two boxes of index cards of campaign contributors' contact information.</p><p> Finally, the "Income Tax Records" series is the only surviving part of what was once a series of personal financial records, spanning the 1960s through the beginning of the Reagan administration, which included cancelled checks, financial statements from investments, receipts, tax returns, trust statements, documentation from family legal issues and statements from charitable organizations. Because these records included personally identifiable information and were of limited research value, the vast majority were separated from the collection, although Baker's tax returns were retained.</p>  </appraisal>

and Contents</head><p>The Early Political Career series documents Baker's first forays into politics in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the material is related to Republican organizations or political campaigns in Texas.</p><p> The most significant materials in the series are the files related to George H.W. Bush, which include material related to Bush's Congressional and Senate campaigns, as well as files of correspondence and notes sent between Bush and Baker from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, including letters sent between the two while Bush was serving as Ambassador to China.</p><p> The Baker-Bush correspondence addresses a wide variety of subjects, both political and personal, and ranges from letters concerning Bush's early Congressional campaigns to light-hearted notes and attempts to schedule tennis matches. The general correspondence folder consists primarily of professional and political correspondence, while the personal notes, letters, and miscellaneous folder tends to contain material that is more personal in nature, although professional and personal material does overlap somewhat in both folders. Highlights of the correspondence include a note sent from Bush to Baker on the day after Bush was passed over for the Vice Presidency in the Ford Administration, and a two-page, single-spaced letter, apparently hand-typed by Bush, sent soon after Bush's arrival in China. In addition to correspondence, the Bush files also include Baker's "political file" from 1969, when Baker, encouraged by Bush and others, was considering running for the Congressional seat vacated when Bush decided to run for Senate. The material, including additional correspondence from Bush, documents Baker's decision not to run for the seat and also includes some material related Bush's Senate campaign and other political topics.</p><p> The remainder of the early political career series documents Baker's involvement in various campaigns (i.e. Archer for Congress) and work with various Republican organizations such as the Republican State and Harris County Finance Committees and the Republican Congressional Boosters Club. There is also a concentration of material related to Senator John Tower (R-Texas).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_82df5270f82ee7ef23e55432846c2365"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is divided into four major groupings.

and Contents</head><p>The Undersecretary of Commerce series consists of correspondence, memos, transcripts, press breakfast briefing material, status reports, and fact sheets related to Baker's 1975 term as Undersecretary of Commerce in the Ford administration. Approximately one third of the series involves the nomination and confirmation process and contains a transcript of the confirmation hearings, correspondence (including many congratulatory letters), and other associated forms and materials. The remainder of the series consists of correspondence, briefing documents, speeches, and other materials related to Baker's term in office. The series also includes a group of subject files which contain material related to a variety of topics, including a 1976 appearance in Oklahoma where Baker, when asked about Henry Kissinger's role in the Ford Administration if Ford were to be elected in 1976, caused a stir in the press.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_9347a56777fa5f80a14f8d776ab6b384"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is divided into two main groupings of material.

The series includes several folders of correspondence, notes, and memos from George H.W. Bush. Much of this material is related to Bush's future campaign for the Republican nomination for president in 1980. The series also includes a grouping of material related to the Fund for Limited Government, a political action committee established by Baker and Bush to explore a possible Bush presidential campaign in 1980. The Fund for Limited Government material includes a substantial amount of correspondence and memos from political strategist Karl Rove, who was a paid consultant for the organization. The series also includes a small amount of correspondence, as well as material related to Baker's involvement with the Associated Republicans of Texas and the Republican National

In addition to position papers and press releases the campaign compiled an "issues binder" that includes position statements and background material on a wide variety of topics. The binder is arranged alphabetically and includes information on a large number of issues such as abortion, environmental regulations, and teachers' pay. The subseries also includes documents pertaining to campaign strategy, including political management proposals, internal memos and correspondence, and background research concerning Baker's opponents.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7abd2b769900437b2daa5ca3eca1f741"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c

In addition to position papers and press releases the campaign compiled an "issues binder" that includes position statements and background material on a wide variety of topics. The binder is arranged alphabetically and includes information on a large number of issues such as abortion, environmental regulations, and teachers' pay. The subseries also includes documents pertaining to campaign strategy, including political management proposals, internal memos and correspondence, and background research concerning Baker's

Reagan's White House Chief of Staff from 1981 to 1985. Baker's influence in the White House, particularly with legislative issues, is documented through correspondence, memoranda and reports, meeting agendas and talking points, and scheduling material. The Office Files and Notes subseries, in particular, includes a large number of memoranda, meeting agendas, and Baker's own handwritten notes related to a wide variety of political, legislative, and other topics. The Legislative Strategy subseries, which includes material generated by the Legislative Strategy Group formed and led by Baker, includes a substantial of amount of significant material related to the major legislative efforts of the first Reagan administration.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ddbc06447b6203b49af4f9eecf2b7456"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is divided into 10 subseries.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC197_c00558" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 6A.

The subseries includes correspondence from prominent figures in American politics and government, including George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Richard Nixon, and Donald Rumsfeld, and senators and Congressional leaders, including Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt, and Newt Gingrich. Of note are letters from George P. Shultz, Lyn Nofziger, and William J. Casey. Much, though not all, of this correspondence is fairly brief. Nixon's correspondence, as with his correspondence in other series, tends to be detailed and involved, and often contains advice and comments on the political climate.</p><p> A substantial proportion of the correspondence comes from non-government contacts, family, and friends, and often consists of notes of congratulations on Baker's appointment, birthday greetings, notes of thanks, and short messages. There are also many requests for consideration for government positions. Preston Moore Jr., Baker's first cousin and a successful Texas businessman, corresponded heavily with Baker and is the largest correspondent in the series.</p><p> The correspondence subseries also includes Baker's personal chronological outgoing correspondence files, which is located at the end of the subseries.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e7436f91f24f47e414aa95002dc1122a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent, and chronologically within each folder.

The subseries contains memos, agendas, reports, and talking points created by the group, as well as memos and correspondence from Senators and Congressmen, and projections on future House and Senate votes. Many of the documents include Baker's handwritten notes and markings.</p><p> Much of the material, especially from the earlier part of Reagan's term, deals with economic concerns, including the Reagan tax package and budgets. Substantial documentation of attempts toward deficit reduction toward the end of Reagan's first term exists in the Group's 1984 files. Other issues include school prayer, Social Security, and U.S. foreign policy in Central America and Lebanon. There is little documentation of one of Reagan's key legislative victories, Congressional approval of the sale of AWAC planes to Saudi Arabia. Most of the files include documents related to both domestic and foreign policy, although, as noted above, the majority of material is related to domestic matters. One folder exclusively contains documents related to foreign policy in 1983, including the deployment of American forces in Lebanon, and administration policy regarding Israel, MX missiles, and the START treaty.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_56ba1f1d944b2a5eabb59141b1fa7e54"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged chronologically, with the exception of foreign policy material which is located at the end of the subseries.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC197_c01157" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981-01/1981-07" type="inclusive">1981 January-July</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_50dcd270f4b015797f21fdf31f0896b1" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126103]" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_ce65f9a82c793cd1f385491b5b21ded6" parent="aspace_50dcd270f4b015797f21fdf31f0896b1" type="folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01158" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">5 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981/1984" type="inclusive">1981-1984</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_9b72d586baf34f328e5f6ac2249bba06" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126111]" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_5e7ed5fd386fc085ee8a1f706d4c543a" parent="aspace_9b72d586baf34f328e5f6ac2249bba06" type="folder">1-5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01159" level="file"><did><unittitle>Foreign Policy</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1983" type="inclusive">1983</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_45f2509ee350d4dc0fc126c54901ccdf" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126111]" type="box">60</container><container id="aspace_19583dbd7467fe295ffac3aff62733cd" parent="aspace_45f2509ee350d4dc0fc126c54901ccdf" type="folder">6</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01160" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 6E.

Baker's handwritten notes and talking points on index cards and legal pad sheets are also included. Handwritten notes are also often present on documents.

The planning strategies and techniques of the transition, which included a comprehensive study of past transitions, as well as detailed plans and strategies for the initial days of the new administration, is sometimes cited as a model for incoming presidential administrations. The subseries includes Baker's own files, as well as the files of Frank Hodsoll, one of Baker's deputies, and various reports. Baker's files consist of memos, notes, and material related to White House staffing. Hodsoll's files include additional information about White House staffing and organization, as well as memos and notes related to the First 90 Days Project, a plan for timing, presentation, and substance of legislative proposals, executive orders, and major public statements during the initial phase of the Reagan administration. Also included is material related to policy development, including documentation of procedures for initiating policy, a report on problems in policy development, and White House orientation material, including notes on staffing and organization. The transition reports describe past transitions between presidential administrations. The highlight is a historical study produced by David Gergen and his team titled "The First Hundred Days." The Gergen study surveyed past transitions in six major categories: constitutional, foreign affairs, domestic affairs, domestic appearances, press and media appearances, and miscellaneous.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7051aee4eed030914bf9b34d211108ee"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged ......</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC197_c01186"

The schedules provide a much greater level of detail and include similar notes on meetings, interviews, and other engagements, both personal and professional, as well as information on locations, time and duration, and whether President Reagan was in attendance. The schedules contain handwritten notes from staff reflecting last-minute updates and cancellations. Most of schedules files include daily schedules for both Baker and Reagan.

The meetings were held almost daily and touch on most of the major issues and events of the first Reagan administration. Although most of the agendas and action items do not include detailed policy information or internal debate, they do provide an excellent timeline of the Administration and its priorities.</p><p> Action items include information regarding a wide range of contemporary issues, the legislative calendar, and events of the day's schedule, such as photo ops. The items generally consist of brief notes of one to two sentences per issue and list staff members responsible for each item. The agendas contain substantial amounts of Baker's handwritten notes made during meetings.</p><p> The meetings concern a range of issues, with a wide assortment of topics discussed at each meeting. Topics include Title IX, Jesse Jackson's involvement with American prisoners held by Fidel Castro in Cuba, the future of MX missiles, Social Security, federal disaster assistance, school prayer, the Clean Air Act, and pay raises for Congress, as well as more routine matters such as the daily schedule and White House parking</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c3a3a1af0f5112e12cfd2bbace32f8a8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged alphabetically.

Materials include correspondence, memoranda, clippings, reports, and other documents. The largest grouping of material in the subseries concerns the 1984 Albosta investigation into the Reagan-Bush election team's acquisition of President Carter's campaign debate briefing information, and includes correspondence, memoranda, and clippings. Of note are copies of the evidence and exhibits compiled by the investigation, which include the Carter briefing documents. Also included is a letter of support to Baker from Dick Cheney.</p><p> Other files include information regarding William Clark, Assistant to the President on National Security Affairs, who pressed for polygraph tests to track press leaks regarding air strikes on Lebanon; the National Security Council, which includes further documentation regarding leaks and some information concerning arms control. The Major League Baseball file consists of notes and documents related to Baker's interest in becoming Baseball Commissioner at the end of Reagan's first term.</p><p> Researchers should note that in many cases substantial documentation of the subjects listed in subject files can be found elsewhere in the series, particularly in the Office and Desk Files and Legislative Strategy Group subseries. Most of the folders in the subject files series contain a small number of documents that appear to have been kept separately from Baker's other files because of their historical importance and interest or other reasons. The Social Security file, for example, includes Ronald Reagan's handwritten notes, while the Ed Meese file includes the original handwritten agreement dividing Baker and Meese's areas of authority in the Reagan White House, as well the 1981 memorandum giving George Bush oversight of crisis management operations which led to conflict with Secretary of State Alexander Haig.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c6ea8d73c2fc4ede8262ad4a2df27893"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC197_c01222" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albosta Investigation</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">2 boxes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980-01-01/1984-12-31" type="inclusive">1980-1984</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_MC197_c01223" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence and Memos</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 box</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983-01-01/1984-12-31" type="inclusive">1983-1984</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_MC197_c01224" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">2 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1984" type="inclusive">1983-1984</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_baebc58b8816783175057aa28687caba" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126269]" type="box">75</container><container id="aspace_702ca48bf875f1a19d7b7cce2585dbd5" parent="aspace_baebc58b8816783175057aa28687caba" type="folder">1-2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01225" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal Letters of Support</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1983" type="inclusive">1983</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_b21d94b47761f61722f2b26e3435a906" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126269]" type="box">75</container><container id="aspace_4e3aa49251e91a44cf497216e7bb9752" parent="aspace_b21d94b47761f61722f2b26e3435a906" type="folder">3</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01226" level="file"><did><unittitle>Court of Appeals Decision, Banzhaf v.

Of note are several letters regarding economic policy from economist Jude Wanniski, as well as correspondence from George H. W. Bush, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Donald T. Regan, Richard Nixon, Pete Wilson, and Senators Phil Gramm and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Some of the correspondence is brief, as in the case of Strom Thurmond, whose file primarily consists of letters of thanks for gifts of South Carolina fruit and cheese.</p><p> As with the correspondence files in other series, the Treasury correspondence includes correspondence with government officials and staff, as well as family and friends. The largest volume of correspondence, like the correspondence files in the Chief of Staff and Secretary of State files, is from Baker's cousin, Preston Moore, Jr.</p><p> The chronological correspondence grouping consists of Baker's personal correspondence files. It primarily contains outgoing correspondence, both of a personal and professional nature. There is slight, but not significant, overlap between the chronological and alphabetical correspondence files.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f6f7f51218eb8a6778810093a7ea4b0d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The Correspondence subseries is arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent, and chronologically within each folder.

The alphabetical correspondence is the largest grouping and generally contains the most significant material. Individuals with multiple pieces of correspondence, as well as more prominent individuals, are listed separately. The alphabetical run of correspondence includes several letters regarding policy from former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon. In addition, there is a good deal of brief correspondence from various foreign dignitaries including Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, Brian Mulroney, Helmut Kohl, and Noboru Takeshita, as well as American political and cultural figures including Bob Dole, Henry Kissinger, and Tom Brokaw.</p><p> The majority of the alphabetical run of correspondence consists of letters to and from government officials and employees and representatives of foreign governments. A small number of letters from extended family and friends is also included. As with Baker's Chief of Staff and Treasury files, a significant volume of correspondence comes from Preston Moore Jr., Baker's cousin and eventual Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Commerce.</p><p> The chronological correspondence consists of Baker's personal chronological correspondence file. It consists primarily of brief outgoing correspondence. There is a small amount of overlap between the alphabetical and chronological runs of correspondence.</p><p> The miscellaneous correspondence includes a grouping of letters of congratulations from both domestic colleagues ad friends and foreign officials upon his nomination and confirmation as Secretary of State, a small group of letters offering condolences on the death of Baker's mother, and a group of thank you letters written by Baker after various trips abroad.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_cdcda98c785cfc372fc1a97ead1b6d44"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent, and chronologically within each folder.

Documents include State Department memos and reports, "memocons" or transcripts of conversations and meetings, drafts and copies of letters and speeches by Bush and Baker, and Baker's handwritten notes and talking points from meetings and phone calls with President Bush as well as foreign leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, and King Fahd. The files document such pivotal events as German reunification, the December 1989 U. S. invasion of Panama, the Gulf War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the Middle East peace process. The subseries includes some of the most significant material in the collection. The January 1991 folder, for example, includes Baker's notes from a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir following the Iraqi missile attack on Tel Aviv, notes prepared for Baker's notification calls to allies regarding the commencement of Operation Desert Storm, extensive notes from Baker's January 9, 1991, meeting with Iraqi Foreign minister Tariq Aziz (as well as Baker opening remarks, a copy of the letter from Bush to Saddam Hussein that Baker delivered to Aziz, and a transcript of the meeting between Baker and Aziz), and numerous other items documenting the beginning of the Gulf War.</p><p> The subseries contains a mixture of photocopies and original documents. Although it is sometimes difficult to decipher or identify Baker's handwritten notes, most documents are dated and labeled with identifying information.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_68d1da611f86f3b8526b08b8faa1791f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC197_c01944" level="file"><did><unittitle>1989 January-1990 April</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">16 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989-01/1990-04" type="inclusive">1989 January-1990 April</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_14eb605f31783d156afe4cb5461e8063" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126590]" type="box">108</container><container id="aspace_7b94cf92d1420931ce7d31f79da404e1" parent="aspace_14eb605f31783d156afe4cb5461e8063" type="folder">1-16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01945" level="file"><did><unittitle>1990 May-1991 January</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">9 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990-05/1991-01" type="inclusive">1990 May-1991 January</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_c6dd39a0084420c92d603ae48f5bf6e3" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126608]" type="box">109</container><container id="aspace_d36982bfd39b60eccebeecd2267a490b" parent="aspace_c6dd39a0084420c92d603ae48f5bf6e3" type="folder">1-9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01946" level="file"><did><unittitle>1991 February-1991 September</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">8 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1991-02/1991-09" type="inclusive">1991 February-1991 September</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_3029891f4f7e6f9cb13ef7e013785bfb" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126616]" type="box">110</container><container id="aspace_79f4fb9fdcda1059b92735f3f0de74f5" parent="aspace_3029891f4f7e6f9cb13ef7e013785bfb" type="folder">1-8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c4596" level="file"><did><unittitle>1991 October-1992 January</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1991-10/1992-01" type="inclusive">1991 October-1992 January</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_9f1ba6a651be350b3ea0bf1444b59b0f" label="Mixed Materials [32101106128406]" type="box">289</container><container id="aspace_ed85071a1ecf1ff7ea7cf9bcc082634f" parent="aspace_9f1ba6a651be350b3ea0bf1444b59b0f" type="folder">1-4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01947" level="file"><did><unittitle>1992 February-1992 August</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">7 folders</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992-02/1992-08" type="inclusive">1992 February-1992 August</unitdate><container altrender="mudd" encodinganalog="NBox" id="aspace_6151025e42ec732a06c2c5372064491d" label="Mixed Materials [32101106126624]" type="box">111</container><container id="aspace_cb923f818994f2d4cd3dfc33ef06400e" parent="aspace_6151025e42ec732a06c2c5372064491d" type="folder">1-7</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_MC197_c01948" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 8D.

The schedules include such information as pickup and drop-off times for Baker, meetings, travel, personal time, and meals (both official and private), as well as activity location and duration; time is scheduled in increments as small as ten minutes. Last-minute changes have been written in by staff; occasionally, there are also handwritten notes concerning the substance of meetings as well as lists of attendees.</p><p> The scheduling summaries grouping consists of the year's major activities briefly summarized and divided into categories.

Bush's campaign during the 1980 Republican Primary, as well as his work as chief delegate hunter for 1976 Ford primary campaign, is also present. The series as a whole provides insight into Republican campaign strategy in the last third of the twentieth century and evidence of the size and complexity of presidential campaign operations of that time period.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7b93d1ec1f429bc8b75fc36a1b55b695"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Series is organized roughly chronologically in 10 subseries..

The subseries contains correspondence, including a small amount of personal correspondence from George Bush, as well as administrative materials such as organizational charts and budgets. Also included are a campaign marketing plan, legal and financial documents, and scheduling materials for Baker, Bush, Reagan, and Gerald Ford. During the campaign Baker was given oversight of debate scheduling and logistics and the most substantial group of material within the subseries, the Debates and Debates Scheduling grouping, documents this role. Included is briefing material, correspondence between Baker, other members of the Reagan campaign team, and the Carter campaign, as well as notes on format and logistics, press releases, and memos relating to the debates and debate scheduling and logistics.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_9e2af032231969ce298cccf0ca8b7236"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged

It includes a variety of correspondence, including letters from such political figures as Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon, whose correspondence includes detailed analysis and strategy suggestions. The subseries also includes material related to presidential debates, including preparatory material and scheduling information, as well as Baker's notes from strategy sessions, and materials regarding a range of legal concerns such as Republican National Committee activities and campaign finance.</p><p> Also included are files documenting communication between the Office of the Vice President in Washington and Bush's campaign operations. The files contain items, including memos and correspondence, sent between the two offices during the spring, summer and fall of 1988. (A small amount of material predates Baker's official involvement with the campaign, which began in August.) A substantial amount of the material in the files consists of carbon copied documents, often from Bush's outgoing and incoming correspondence, that Bush, Baker, or their staffs forwarded or copied to each other. The files also contain some notes and letters sent between Bush and Baker. Although most of the material is focused on the campaign, a few light-hearted notes are also present.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

scrapbooks created by Baker's staff during his time as White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State, as well as during various political campaigns. Whenever possible the material has been removed from binders and scrapbooks and rehoused for preservation purposes.</p><p> The series is divided into two subseries, Weekly and Monthly Scrapbooks and Yearly Scrapbooks. Scrapbooks in both subseries include newspaper and magazine clippings. The Weekly and Monthly Scrapbooks consist primarily of clippings with other material, such as press conference transcripts, schedules, or White House phone records also present. The Yearly Scrapbooks are more likely to include memorabilia, such as identification badges for major events, or mementos from trips abroad. The Chief of Staff Scrapbook 1 (Box 246) includes Baker's handwritten notes from March 30, 1981, the day of the attempted assignation attempt on President Reagan.</p><p> Researchers should note that a small number of clippings can be found within the other individual series.</p><p> The series also contains two boxes of memorabilia, including campaign buttons from Baker's attorney general campaign, foreign versions of The Politics of Diplomacy, and miscellaneous binders and portfolios from Baker's work on presidential campaigns or his various government positions.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_40d0a39696bf61bd18b251771f857560"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is divided into three major groupings.

The majority of tapes in the series are VHS videotapes of Baker's appearances on television news programs or recordings of television news stories that include mention of Baker. Some recordings of speeches and public appearances are also available. The videocassettes created between 1988 and 1992, during Baker's years at the State Department, often contain multiple programs or events on a single tape. In addition to the contents list, a more detailed index to the State Department "Master Tapes" is available in Box 262.</p><p> The series also includes a small number of audiocassette tapes, which include audio of Baker appearances on the CBS news program Face the Nation and other unidentified cassettes.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
