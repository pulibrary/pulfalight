Because the book was published in both the US and the UK, a significant portion of the correspondence is between McElderry and editors at the UK publishing house (The Bodley Head), regarding the dual publication process.

Many of the letters regard family: a library school recommendation for Estes's daughter Helena written by McElderry; the heart attacks of Estes's brother Clarence; the death of brain cancer of Helena's husband Stephen Haeseler; and reports of vacations, including a 1979 trip to Spain and Tangiers in which Estes and her husband visited with authors Virginia Sorensen and Alec Waugh. Related to Estes's work, correspondence topics include Estes's growing dissatisfaction with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; reviews of <emph render="italic">The Tunnel of Hugsy Goode</emph>; Estes's fanmail; whether Estes should illustrate Ann Warren Griffith's story "The Bed Book"; concerns about royalties; submission of work for potential publication including "Jimmy Mannikin," based on stories Estes wrote for Helena, and "The Flea Circus," originally published in <emph render="italic">Cricket Magazine</emph>; a speech Estes gave in appreciation of children's librarian and author Anne Carroll Moore; and discussion about whether Estes should donate her personal archive to the Kerlan Collection at the University of Minnesota. There are also a number of poems written by Estes to McElderry, including "Sad Ballad of an Analogous Man," about Sidney Long, written after he wrote a bad review of <emph render="italic">Hugsy Goode</emph> in the New York Times (spring 1972), and "There once was a girl in Barbados," written after McElderry's vacation to Barbados (April 5, 1975).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref351" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Coat Hanger Christmas Tree</unittitle></did><arrangement id="aspace_ref354"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Chronological</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_ref475"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Correspondence primarily between McElderry, Estes, McElderry's secretaries Florence Sczesny and Judy Long, and illustrator Susanne Suba about this story of a girl whose mother does not want the family to have a Christmas tree. The book was Estes's first with McElderry at Atheneum; the two had worked together when McElderry was at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and the file includes correspodence with William Jovanovich regarding the Estes's requested release from her contract with the firm. Other topics of correspondence include much discussion of the book's drawings: McElderry and Estes considered Edward Ardizzone, Cyndy Szekeres, and Trina Schart Hyman before choosing Susanne Suba, and Estes was initially unhappy with the drawings, though she never communicated this to Suba. McElderry and Estes also discuss line edits to the manuscipt, trim size and font, and the terms of Estes's contract. Estes had recently moved to New Haven, CT, and she and McElderry talk about which bookshops to market to and how to get Estes involved at the Yale Co-Op. Other correspondence includes McElderry shopping the book to English publishers, including Bodley Head, Longman Young, Lutterworth Press, William Heinemann, and Ernest Benn, Ltd., and to Shigeo Watanabe and the Charles E. Tuttle, Co. in Japan. Oxford University Press eventually bought the English rights, and there are several letters between McElderry and editor Paul Binding; the two also discuss <emph render="italic">The Moon on the One Hand</emph> by Bill Crofut, OUP books McElderry would like to see, the possibility of doing a joint children's book project with Reynolds Price, and a late payment from OUP to Susanne Suba. Other promotional topics include the book's selection by the Junior Literary Guild, permission for Miller-Brody Productions to use images from it in a "Meet the Newbery Author" filmstrip, interest in a German translation from Obelisk, interest from Women's Day Magazine, and a letter from a schoolteacher asking for biographical information about Estes. In 1979, McElderry wrote to Estes to ask if Atheneum could lower her royalties in order to keep the book in print. Additional topics include whether Estes should get an agent to handle movie and television rights for her work, putting together a biographical pamphlet on Estes, and the launch party for <emph render="italic">Cricket Magazine</emph>. The two also talk about Estes's husband's various accidents and health issues and the death of her brother Clarence, as well as Lucy Boston's chapter on McElderry's wedding in her book <emph render="italic">Memory of a House</emph>.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref352" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Lost Umbrella of Kim Chu</unittitle></did><arrangement id="aspace_ref355"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Chronological</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_ref476"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Correspondence primarily between McElderry, Estes, McElderry's secretary, and later editor, Judy Long, and illustrator Jacqueline Ayer regarding this story about a girl who loses her father's umbrella in New York City's Chinatown. Topics include McElderry's general suggestions for the manuscript, line edits, and layout for the book, as well as the time crunch to publish by fall 1978 (Estes had hoped to work in person with both McElderry and Ayer, but time did not permit). Before McElderry and Estes chose Ayer as the illustrator, they considered Sag Harbor-based artist Joan Baren; the file includes xeroxes of her character sketches, but Estes found the drawings too stylized and potentially racially offensive. Also included are a map of Kim's home drawn by Estes (undated), and a limerick written by Estes in response to McElderry's request for flap copy, which Estes did not like to write (Dec. 30, 1977). The book was published in England by Oxford Univeristy Press, and there is correspondence with Antony Kamm, children's book editor; Oetinger Verlag in Hamburg was interested in the German rights. McElderry and Estes also discuss whether Estes will allow the Foundry Bookstore in New Haven, CT, to throw her a publication party. The final letter in the file discusses Estes's displeasure with some of Ayer's illustrations, as well as plans for <emph render="italic">The Moffat Museum,</emph> published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World in 1983. Personal topics include Estes's son-in-law Stephen's brain tumor, her husband's many health problems, and her cancelled 1978 trip to Madrid and Tangiers with a visit to authors Virginia Sorensen and Alec Waugh. McElderry and Estes also discuss the delay in McElderry's work after her husband's death, and the honorary degree she received from Mt. Holyoke College in 1978. There are also a number of letters between McElderry and Ayer, discussing Ayer's world travels and a sum of money she owed to McElderry.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_ref95" level="series"><did><unittitle>Penelope Farmer</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1971/1985" type="inclusive">1971 - 1985</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ref96" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1971/1985" type="inclusive">1971-1985</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ref322"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>General correspondence between Farmer and McElderry, and between McElderry and others, especially her agent Deborah Owen, regarding Farmer's work.

Other professional correspondence includes discussion of a promotional booklet about Farmer published by Atheneum in winter 1972, an October 1976 article about Farmer in Horn Book Magazine, and the unauthorized use of lines from Farmer's 1969 novel Charlotte Sometimes in a song by The Cure. McElderry and Farmer discuss three of Farmer's visits to the US: a fall 1972 visit to New York; a summer 1973 tour sponsored by Atheneum, including appearances at the Intermountain conference in Utah and the Loughborough conference in Towson, MD, publicity tours of the southwest and California, and Labor Day weekend with McEdlerry and her husband on Nantucket; and a summer 1975 visit to New York accompanied by her husband Michael Mockridge and their children.

The file includes a xerox of one of the mock ups for the book. Much of the correspondence regards marketing: McElderry submitted the title for the American Library Association's Mildred Batchelder Award for most outstanding translation of a children's book, Dana and Frasconi arranged to exhibit the original artwork at Brentano's Bookstore in Manhasset, NY and stage a dramatic performance there on November 16, 1972, and Dana read the book aloud on WBAI's children's storytelling program. McElderry also sent the book to institutions such as the Council for Interracial Books for Children, and La Casa del Libro in Puerto Rico. The file includes reviews and letters of reaction from booksellers and friends. It also includes correspondence related to Dana's other work, including her April 1972 recognition by the American Center of PEN for other translations of Mistral, and a talk she gave at the Israel-Ibero American Institute in 1973.

Topics include discussion of Dana's expansion of the story and her translation of the expanded parts back into Spanish, and whether she should be credited as translator or author. There is also correspondence between McEdlerry and Pura Belpre White, a librarian at the New York Public Library, whom McElderry asked to read Dana's manuscript for regionalism in the Spanish; the file includes a typescript of the book annotated by White. Correspondence with Fransconi includes discussion of Frasconi's complicated relationship with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and of the book's color and design. As with <emph render="italic">Crickets and Frogs</emph>, there is much discussion of marketing, including which bookstores the book should be placed in, McElderry's hope that Daves will shop the rights to England, Germany and Brazil, and the excitement created by the book. Chatto &amp; Windus was initially interested in the English rights, and McElderry's correspondence with editor Jane Birkett also includes discussion of Penelope Farmer's work; Editora Gaviota of Brazil took Portuguese-language rights. Additionally, there is discussion of the Book's selection as an American Library Association Notable Book for 1974, its inclusion in the 1975 Margaret Scoggin Memorial Collections of IBBY (a collection of excellent books sent to places where the publishing market is not fully developed), and its consideration for American Library Association's Margaret Batchelder Award for books in translation. McElderry corresponds with Della Thomas of the ALA about whether the book can really be considered a translation, but she is unable to get in touch with Dana and it seems that after March 1975, McElderry and Dana were never again in contact.

Maclean, and Richard Garnett about this book of paintings depicting a day in the life of two boys during King Edward's reign. The project began as a gift for Goodall's wife Margaret and became the first in a series of pictorial works about life in England at the turn of the 20th century. Correspondence topics include how to market the book for both adults and children, whether there should be text to accompany the pictures and who should write it (Harold Macmillan eventually wrote a short foreward), size and design of the book, whether to print in Hong Kong or in England, how to insure the quality of the printing and McElderry's disappointment with the printer's initial work, slight differences in layout between UK and US editions, and McElderry's April 1976 visit to the UK. There are also letters between Marvin S. Brown, executive vice president of Atheneum, and Theresa Sacco, director at Macmillan, discussing disagreements between the firms about payment schedules for this book and future projects. Initially, McElderry had hoped that Artemis Verlag of Switzerland would join the printing run with Macmillan and Atheneum, and the file contains correspondence with Bruno Mariacher regarding his decision not to take the book due to its lack of text; a Dutch version was printed at the same time as the US and UK editions. The file also includes xeroxed mockups of the volume's cover and a draft of Macmillan's foreward edited by McElderry.

Topics include whether or not Atheneum will be included in Macmillan's initial printing run, whether to print in Hong Kong or in England, delay of American release from Spring to Fall of 1980, and the shipment of preview copies twice being lost in the mail.
