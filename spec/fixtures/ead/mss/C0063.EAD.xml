         <p>Andre De Coppet (1892-1953) was an American broker and collector of Americana. He was
            born in New York in 1892 to Edward J. and Pauline De Coppet. A 1915 graduate of
            Princeton University, he inherited a position in the family stock exchange firm of De
            Coppet &amp; Doremus after the death of his father in 1916. In 1920 he wed Clara Barclay
            Onativia in New York. In the mid-1920s he took an interest in Haiti and invested in a
            sisal plantation there. Through the 1920s and 1930s, De Coppet amassed a significant
            collection of European and American manuscripts, which were bequeathed to universities
            upon his death in 1953.</p>

            <p>This collection represents the American history-related collecting activities of
               Andre De Coppet (Princeton Class of 1915), one of the foremost American collectors of
               his generation. Ranging in period from the Spanish colonization of Florida (1566) to
               President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term, the collection is comprised of
               letters, documents, manuscripts, and printed materials from hundreds of important
               American historical figures. Though it spans centuries, the collection has three
               major foci in American history: the Revolutionary War, the Federal Period, and the
               Civil War. Most prominently represented are the presidents of the United States,
               including all from Washington through Truman. The amount of material affiliated with
               each individual or subject varies widely, though there are a number significant
               larger groups:</p>
            <p>A group of letters and documents written by George Washington (1732-1799) spans his
               entire adult life and includes over 150 items. The earliest items are Virginia land
               surveys conducted in the 1750s. The bulk of the material dates from the years of the
               Revolutionary War (1775-1783). Many of the letters detail the countless important
               decisions Washington was forced to make as commander of America's revolutionary
               forces, from issues of staffing and rank to how to adequately provision soldiers with
               clothing and food. Also included are letters and documents from Washington's time as
               president, including two and a half pages of an undelivered inaugural address, and
               letters debating the extent of constitutional and congressional powers.</p>
            <p>The collection includes an equally rich group of personal and professional
               correspondence from Washington’s trusted general Nathanael Greene (1742-1786). The
               Greene correspondence, dating from 1775-1785, is primarily focused on his service in
               the Revolutionary War, from the difficulties he experienced as quartermaster general
               to his appointment as commander of the Southern Army. His letters to Washington and
               other army officers communicate troop locations and various successes and failures of
               the war. In addition, they highlight the difficult conditions experienced by many
               Continental soldiers who lacked appropriate shoes, clothing, and food. Personal
               correspondence between Nathanael and his wife, brothers, and cousin reveal the
               family's investment in multiple privateering ventures, as well as the family
               ironworks, which was occasionally commissioned to make weapons for the war.</p>
            <p>Additional materials related to the Revolutionary War abound. Correspondence and
               documents from dozens of American officers are filed under their respective names. A
               United States Continental Army file includes official muster rolls, payrolls,
               warrants, and ration receipts from various New England companies. A general American
               Revolutionary War file includes correspondence from unknown or lesser known
               individuals who were involved in the war or lived during the time period, as well as
               two lengthy manuscripts written by unidentified Englishmen, one in favor of the
               revolution and the other opposed.</p>
            <p>The Asa Waterman correspondence chronicles the failures of the early commissariat
               system, which was established during (and in response to) the Revolutionary War.
               Waterman (1743-1789), originally a ship merchant, served as assistant commissary in
               Rhode Island from 1777 to 1780. Comprised of approximately 100 items, his
               correspondence highlights the difficulty of provisioning the troops with adequate,
               nutritious food due to a scarcity of staples (most often flour) and the problem of
               shipping goods at the risk of enemy seizure. His letters also address the frequent
               reorganization of the commissariat system and its negative effect on both the
               commissary officers and the troops they served.</p>
            <p>In addition to papers of various official military officers, the collection includes
               the business papers of Samuel White and John Cushing, merchants and privateers during
               the American Revolutionary War. Privateers were sanctioned by the government to aid
               in the war effort by capturing enemy ships, known as "prizes." Privateers played a
               significant role in the war, outnumbering government-owned vessels by more than ten
               to one and capturing nearly 600 British ships over the course of the war. Cushing
               &amp; White invested in multiple vessels that sailed along the North American coast
               and to the West Indies throughout the course of the war.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains significant holdings from the post-war Federal period.
               Correspondence from John Adams (1735-1826) is largely focused on his role as diplomat
               for the newly formed American nation in the years before he became second president
               of the United States. His letters include strong viewpoints on the American
               government and his role within it. He laments the "insignificance" of his position as
               vice president (under George Washington), discusses the growth of democracy in
               various states, and complains that the American people have little tolerance for
               hardship.</p>
            <p>Third U.S. President Thomas Jefferson has over 100 items in the collection. His
               correspondents are a veritable who's who of early American leaders. Topics range from
               subjects of personal interest (e.g., what materials should be used to decorate
               Monticello, his Virginia estate) to American agriculture, foreign diplomacy, and
               relations with Native Americans. Not one to mince words, Jefferson strongly states
               his opinions on political rivalries, government policies, and international
               relations, often touching on multiple issues within single letters. The letters also
               provide a glimpse of his scientific and inventive pursuits including a diagram for an
               improved water wheel and his establishment of a nail manufactory.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains significant holdings from the American Civil War.
               Correspondence from Union general (and eighteenth U.S. President) Ulysses S. Grant
               Grant dates from 1858-1884. Many of the letters were sent directly from the
               battlefields of the Civil War. His correspondence with other generals and army
               officers captures the fevered pace and constant strategizing of the war. The
               progression of certain battles can be traced through the many notes he sent
               throughout the same day, week, or month. Telegraph notes marked "cipher" highlight
               the threat of enemy interception. Many of his letters in this collection were written
               from City Point, Virginia, the Union headquarters and base of supplies during 1864
               and 1865.</p>
            <p>Additional Civil War materials include select letters and documents from other
               prominent Civil War officers including Union general William T. Sherman and
               Confederate general Robert E. Lee, as well as a large group of official papers from
               the United States Army of the Potomac consisting of orders, regulations,
               appointments, and official correspondence. A general American Civil War file contains
               items relating to relatively unknown men who served in the war and wrote about their
               experiences; collectively, they provide a glimpse of the impact of the war on average
               soldiers and their families. The Frederic A. Waterhouse correspondence, between a
               young Union soldier and his family in Pennsylvania, vividly traces one family’s
               experience of the war and follows Frederic through battles, injury, and eventually
               death in the field.</p>
            <p>The papers of sixteenth President Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) form one of the largest
               groups in the collection. The earliest items date from Lincoln’s time as a lawyer.
               Included are legal briefs from all three of his formal law partnerships as well as
               cases from his time on the Illinois judicial circuit. Correspondence includes letters
               both to and from Lincoln; a handful of letters deal specifically with the Civil War.
               Documents from his time as president mainly consist of memoranda, discharges,
               pardons, commissions, and orders.</p>
            <p>Other well-represented American presidents include Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919),
               whose letters reflect many of the positions he held before being elected president,
               and Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), whose correspondence demonstrates his lifelong
               passion for the study of government and history.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of other American individuals and subjects are covered by the collection.
               There are significant letters from Americans of the stature of Samuel Adams, John C.
               Calhoun, Henry Clay, Benjamin Franklin, and Patrick Henry, and informative and
               characteristic ones of such diverse personages as John Wilkes Booth, Robert Fulton,
               and Thomas Paine. A large group of papers from eighteenth and nineteenth-century
               Massachusetts is filed by town and contains many legal documents in the form of land
               deeds, writs, and tax forms.</p>
            <p>Researchers should note that Andre De Coppet saved many clippings from the auctions
               and dealers where he purchased the items in this collection. These clippings and
               provenance files are available in Boxes 43 and 44.</p>

               <p>John Adams served as an elected member of the First and Second Continental
                  Congresses, a U.S. diplomat, vice president under George Washington, and second
                  president of the United States (1797-1801). This series primarily consists of
                  select letters written by Adams from 1775 to 1816. Recipients include prominent
                  Americans such as John Jay (1745-1829), James Madison (1749-1812), Benjamin Rush
                  (1746-1813), and John Trumbull (1750-1831)—who received over a third of the
                  letters in this collection. Subject matter is nearly always political in nature
                  whether official government communication or personal correspondence. Also
                  included are three miscellaneous documents signed by Adams. The series is arranged
                  alphabetically by name of correspondent with the three miscellaneous documents
                  housed in Box 46 (oversize). Many of the letters have been published in
                  multi-volume series devoted to Adams. Two such sources were consulted in the
                  preparation of this finding aid:</p>

               <p>Letters in this collection that are published in either of these series contain a
                  bracketed notation in the item description including the above designated
                  abbreviations (by publisher), volume, and page number. Since Adams often wrote
                  multiple copies of his letters as well as kept a letter-book, multiple
                  institutions may own copies of the same letter. An asterisk (*) in the item
                  description designates the citing of this specific copy of the letter. RC
                  indicates the item is the original recipient’s copy.</p>

               <p>John Quincy Adams is best known for being the son of John Adams and serving as
                  sixth president of the United States (1825-1829). Prior to his presidency he also
                  served in multiple diplomatic positions and as secretary of state under James
                  Monroe. This series primarily consists of letters and documents written by Adams
                  from 1786 to 1848. The letters are both personal and professional in nature and
                  span varying stages of his career from diplomat to congressman to president. Also
                  included are four manuscripts—two poems, a speech delivered to Congress, and
                  minutes of a cabinet meeting. Folders are arranged alphabetically by correspondent
                  with manuscripts at the end.</p>

                  <p>Bailey was an American physician and Civil War officer. This bound volume of
                     letters includes 9 ALsS written by Bailey to his friend John Hill Martin,
                     largely discussing friendly matters, with mention of West Point classmate U.S.
                     Grant. Only one of the letters was written from war. At the end of the volume
                     are 3 letters written after Bailey's death, describing how he was killed at
                     Guyandotte, West Virginia on November 10, 1861, when he was thrown over the
                     side of a bridge by Confederate forces. In the front of the volume, Samuel W.
                     Pennypacker (Governor of Pennsylvania from 1903-1907) inscribed a message on
                     August 28, 1914. 12 pieces in bound volume.</p>

                  <p>This group of letters centers around Frederic A. Waterhouse, a young man from
                     Pennsylvania who served with Union forces in the American Civil War. The
                     majority of the letters are between Frederic, his father (E.G. Waterhouse), his
                     mother, and his sister (Lucretia). A few of the correspondents are other family
                     members or friends. The letters vividly trace the impact of the war on one
                     family. The letters follow Frederic's army career from a short-lived stint in
                     the field, to an illness that left him unfit for fighting, to his reassignment
                     to the "invalid corps" and the army's decision to put him in charge of a
                     hospital ward. Frederic's letters from the field and the hospitals describe
                     common war themes: lack of food and clothing, horribly injured men, the desire
                     for the war to end, etc. The letters from the family to Frederic highlight
                     their constant fear for his safety and health, and their attempts to comfort
                     him by sending news from home. The final two letters were written to Frederic's
                     father, informing him that his son was mortally wounded to the head and died
                     November 1, 1864, only a month after rejoining his regiment in the field. The
                     final folder includes 12 of the original envelopes in which the letters were
                     sent.</p>

                     <p>An unbound manuscript entitled "A Brief History of the American War." The
                        writer was an Englishman who supported the colonies' fight for independence.
                        A "Preliminary Discourse" and the early chapters of the main text largely
                        consist of the author's philosophical viewpoints on war, religion, and civil
                        government. Later chapters include more historical detail. The history is
                        incomplete, stopping with an account of a 1778 battle in Rhode Island. The
                        manuscript was originally housed in a wooden box covered in brown leather
                        with gold tooling on which is written "The Revd. E. Cartwright." (Now housed
                        in Box 5a). Initial speculation that the manuscript may have been written by
                        British reformer Major John Cartwright or his brother Edmund Cartwright has
                        been quelled, largely based on the author's extremely antagonistic view of
                        the Church of England, of which both Cartwrights were members. The author
                        never references himself by name, making attribution difficult and
                        speculative. The manuscript consists of four parts: an introductory letter
                        (partial), a 46-page "Preliminary Discourse," the 265-page history (split
                        into 7 books), and a few short addendums. In addition, the author wrote
                        summary descriptions of the sections and chapters. It is foldered in the
                        order it is intended to be read, with the addendums at the end.</p>

               <p>James Buchanan served as fifteenth President of the United States (1857-1861). His
                  letters in this collection date from 1822 to 1864 and touch on a variety of
                  miscellaneous matters. While much of the correspondence is official, a few of the
                  letters contain Buchanan's personal viewpoints on various political issues and
                  candidates. Of note are an 1838 letter to the <emph render="italic">Pennsylvania
                     Enquirer</emph> and an 1856 pamphlet, both of which refute an alleged statement
                  made by Buchanan which came to be known as the "drop of blood falsehood."</p>

               <p>In 1792, a French land company, <emph render="italic">Compagnie de New
                  York</emph>, bought 600,000 acres of land in Tompkins County, NY, with the
                  intention of splitting it into lots and selling them for a profit. To promote
                  sales the tract was called Castorland, castor being the French word for beaver.
                  Ultimately, the venture proved unsuccessful due to problems with the land and lack
                  of funds. The company dissolved in 1814.</p>

               <p>This series consists of the papers of business partners Samuel White and John
                  Cushing (1743-1822), merchants and privateers during the American Revolution.
                  Cushing &amp; White operated out of Boston and acted as administrative agents and
                  part-owners in multiple vessels that sailed along the North American coast and to
                  the West Indies. John Cushing appears to have been the leader in the partnership
                  as the bulk of papers bear his name. Cushing was a native of Massachusetts, born
                  in Scituate, Plymouth County in 1743 to John and Deborah Barker Cushing. In 1773
                  he married Olive Wallingford, daughter of Colonel Thomas and Elizabeth
                  Wallingford. He was chosen Colonel, 2nd Plymouth County Regiment in 1776 but
                  resigned the commission in 1779 citing ill health. By that time, he had already
                  started his merchant and privateering partnership with Samuel White. By
                  definition, privateers were privately funded but government sanctioned vessels
                  that preyed on enemy ships. Captured ships were known as "prizes," and the goods
                  and cargo on board were sold to the profit of the owners and crewmembers.
                  Privateers played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War,
                  outnumbering government-owned vessels by more than ten to one and capturing nearly
                  600 British ships over the course of the war. Cushing &amp; White acted as agents
                  and owners of various ships outfitted for privateering, most prominently from
                  1777-1780. They experienced both successes and failures but by 1784 seemed to have
                  fallen into serious financial difficulties. A letter dated 1787 to "John
                  Cushing—Supervising partner of the late House of Messrs. Cushing &amp; White"
                  suggests by then the partnership dissolved—either due to bankruptcy or the death
                  of Samuel White. Papers dating from 1784 onward suggest Cushing continued to earn
                  his living as a merchant. The papers in the series are largely focused on the
                  privateering years, and include correspondence, financial records, and official
                  documents often signed by captains and crewmembers. Subject matter is focused on
                  investments, prizes, the sale of captured goods, and the threat of the enemy. Of
                  note is a printed license to arm issued by the Continental Congress and signed by
                  president John Hancock. The papers are arranged alphabetically by name of ship,
                  with miscellaneous material at the end. Known information about the ship is given
                  in the description. Within the ship folders, the papers are arranged
                  chronologically unless otherwise noted.</p>

                     of Newfoundland. During the second cruise, in June of 1779, <emph

                  Spain's harsh response and massacre of French settlers there. Also included is

               <p>A prominent figure in the founding of the United States, Benjamin Franklin was,
                  among other things, an author &amp; printer, politician, and diplomat. Each of
                  these roles is represented in this series dating from 1740-1789. His
                  correspondence includes transactions from his printing business (including a 1740
                  printing from his press); official documents signed as President of the Executive
                  Council of Pennsylvania; letters concerning funding and supplies for the American
                  government and army; and letters from his service as a diplomat in Europe
                  negotiating the terms of the new American nation.</p>

               <p>Grant served as the leading Union general in the American Civil War and eighteenth
                  President of the United States (1869–1877). This file dates from 1858-1884 and
                  primarily consists of correspondence written before and after his Presidency.
                  Grant's role as general is prominently featured as many of the letters were sent
                  directly from the battlefields of the Civil War. His correspondence with other
                  generals and army officers captures the fevered pace and constant strategizing of
                  the war. The progression of certain battles can be traced through the many notes
                  he sent throughout the same day, week, or month. Telegraph notes marked "cipher"
                  highlight the threat of enemy interception. Many of the letters were written from
                  City Point, Virginia, the Union headquarters and base of supplies during 1864 and
                  1865. In addition to correspondence, there are miscellaneous documents at the end
                  of the series.</p>

               <p>Nathanael Greene served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary
                  War. This series, dating from 1775-1785, consists of personal and professional
                  correspondence from the last decade of his life and includes letters both to and
                  from Greene. Many of the letters are directly related to his service in the
                  Revolutionary War, including the difficulties he experienced while serving as
                  Quartermaster General from March to August 1778. After resigning that post, Greene
                  proved himself a leader on the battlefield as evidenced by his many communications
                  with Commander in Chief George Washington. His letters to Washington and other
                  army officers communicate troop locations and various successes and failures of
                  the war. In addition, they highlight the difficult conditions experienced by many
                  Continental soldiers who lacked appropriate shoes, clothing, and food. Personal
                  correspondence between Nathanael and his wife, brothers, and cousin reveal the
                  family's investment in multiple privateering ventures, as well as a family
                  ironworks, which was occasionally commissioned to make weapons for the war.</p>
               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent. Many of the
                  letters have been published in a multi-volume series devoted to Greene: <emph
                     render="italic"> The Papers of General Nathanael Greene</emph> (Chapel Hill :
                  Published for the Rhode Island Historical Society [by] University of North
                  Carolina Press, 1976-2005). Letters in this collection that are published in this
                  series contain a bracketed notation in the item description citing the volume and
                  page numbers. In some instances, the letters may not be published in full but
                  merely summarized; in such cases the volume and page number are still provided as
                  the editors often provide helpful footnotes and context for researchers.</p>

                  circular letters distributed to collectors across the United States and multiple
                  letters to officers at the Bank of New York (which he founded in 1784). A few of
                  the items relate to his work as a lawyer as well as his military service. The
                  items are arranged in three files: Letters, Circular Letters, and Documents.</p>

               <p>Warren G. Harding was an American politician from Ohio who served as the
                  twenty-ninth President of the United States (1921-1923). This series includes both
                  personal and professional correspondence sent by and to Harding. A number of
                  letters relate to his success as publisher and owner of Ohio newspaper the <emph
                     render="italic">Marion Star</emph>. The series also includes over thirty
                  letters sent from both Warren and his wife (Florence) to Charles R. Forbes, a
                  friend whom Harding appointed head of the Veterans' Bureau. (Forbes later proved
                  to be corrupt and was convicted for improprieties conducted while in office.)
                  Other letters address various political and governmental business, including a
                  group of letters to Frank A. Harrison, who was frustrated with the U.S.
                  representation at the Brazilian International Centennial Exposition of 1922. Two
                  miscellaneous documents and a photograph are housed at the end of the series.</p>

               <p>Thomas Jefferson was an extremely influential American statesman who served as the
                  first U.S. secretary of state (1789-1793), the second vice president (1797-1801,
                  under John Adams), and the third president (1801–1809). This series largely
                  consists of letters written by Jefferson, the contents of which provide a
                  veritable who's who of American Revolutionary leaders. Topics range from subjects
                  of personal interest (e.g. what materials should be used to decorate Monticello,
                  his Virginia estate) to matters of national and international importance. Not one
                  to mince words, Jefferson strongly states his opinions on political rivalries,
                  government policies, and international relations, often touching on multiple
                  issues within single letters. The letters also provide a glimpse of his scientific
                  and inventive pursuits including a diagram for an improved water wheel and his
                  establishment of a nail manufactory (see letters to Zane and Remsen
                  respectively).</p>

               <p>These documents relating to the League of Nations were gathered by Clarence M.
                  Peacock, who was involved in the printing of various documents published by the
                  American Commission to Negotiate Peace and other League of Nations committees. The
                  file includes Peacock's own accounts of how, when, and where the documents were
                  printed, and his honor at being involved in the League, if only from a mechanical
                  standpoint. A few of the documents contain inscriptions from political leaders,
                  acknowledging Peacock's role in the printing. Some of the documents are printer's
                  proofs.</p>

               <p>Abraham Lincoln served as sixteenth President of the United States, from March
                  1861 until his death on April 15, 1865. This series dates from 1839-1865 and
                  includes correspondence and documents pertaining to his Presidency as well his
                  many years as a lawyer in Illinois. The series is divided into five main sections:
                  Correspondence, Law Partnership Documents, Presidential Documents, Autograph
                  Clippings, and Miscellaneous. Brief descriptions of the holdings are provided at
                  the beginning of each section.</p>
               <p>Many of Lincoln's letters and documents have been published at various times and
                  in various formats. For the purposes of this finding aid, two main sources were
                  consulted. The first was the multi-volume series: <emph render="italic">The
                     Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</emph>, Roy P. Basler, editor (New
                  Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, c1953-1990). Letters and documents in
                  this collection that are published in this series contain a bracketed notation
                  citing the volume and page numbers. The other main source was <emph
                     render="italic">The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary
                     Edition</emph>, available on CD-ROM; a full citation is provided at the
                  beginning of the law partnership files.</p>
               <p>Patrons will be given access to surrogate, photoduplicated copies of the Lincoln
                  materials.</p>

                  <p>The items in this file date from 1846-1864. Included are many appointments and
                     promotions for government and military officers. A handful of letters deal
                     specifically with the Civil War including a pair of letters to General Joseph
                     Hooker and an 1862 letter to General Don C. Buell proposing a military
                     strategy. Also of note are two letters to John A.J. Creswell and Henry W.
                     Hoffman respectively, in which Lincoln strongly urges the ratification of a new
                     Maryland constitution which would free the state's slaves: "I wish all men to
                     be free." The file is arranged alphabetically by correspondent and contains
                     letters both to and from Lincoln. The majority of the letters sent to Lincoln
                     also contain some notation in his hand (noted in descriptions).</p>

                  <p>Lincoln had three successive formal law partnerships: junior partner to John
                     Todd Stuart, junior partner to Stephen T. Logan, and senior partner to William
                     H. Herndon. Documents pertaining to cases involving these men are filed under
                     the name of the respective partnership. Lincoln was also involved in the
                     Illinois judicial circuit, which required him to travel to various counties to
                     either assist local attorneys or directly represent local litigants. This
                     occasionally resulted in temporary, informal partnerships. Documents from such
                     partnerships and other miscellaneous legal documents are housed in a separate
                     folder at the end. Many of the dates are taken from docketing by court clerks.

               <p>This series contains papers relating to various towns in Massachusetts. The
                  majority of items are legal documents in the form of land deeds, writs, and tax
                  forms. The series is arranged alphabetically by name of town and chronologically
                  within each town file. In the cases of documents featuring multiple parties, the
                  following arrangement generally applies: Writs are filed by the town of the
                  defendant. Letters are filed by the town of the writer. Land deeds are filed by
                  the town in which the land was located. Researchers should note that individuals
                  and families may be found in multiple documents both within town files as well as
                  across the entire series. Of particular note in this regard are Justice of the
                  Peace Abel Lawrence and Massachusetts Congressional Representative John Locke. The
                  final folder in the series contains miscellaneous general documents related to the
                  state of Massachusetts.</p>

                     <p>Various papers issued by and to Justice of the Peace Abel Lawrence including
                        many writs involving various residents of Groton. Almost all the writs
                        require one party to pay another party or contest in court. Most have notes
                        and final judgments written on the back. All writs are half leaf printed
                        forms with names and specifics filled in by hand.</p>

                     <p>In the early 1730s, a group of Boston merchants attempted to regulate the
                        circulation of money in Massachusetts by giving loans based on individual
                        credit. This indenture for a bond issued to John Walley is an example of one
                        of their loans. Printed form, signed by the ten merchants (Edward
                        Hutchinson, John Osborne, Jacob Wendell, etc.) and witnessed by two others.

               <p>James Monroe (1758-1831) was an American politician who served in various
                  high-ranking government positions including governor of Virginia, secretary of
                  war, secretary of state, and fifth president of the United States (1817-1825). He
                  is known for his influence on U.S. foreign policy, most notably through the Monroe
                  Doctrine (1823), which opposed the interference of any European powers in the
                  affairs of newly independent nations of the Western hemisphere. His letters in
                  this collection reflect his involvement in international diplomacy as he wrote to
                  and about various U.S. foreign ministers and affairs of state. Also included are a
                  handful of letters dealing with his personal life and estate, which highlight
                  financial difficulties and the sale of property in Europe and America.
                  Miscellaneous documents at the end include a couple of speeches. [Some of the

               <p>Theodore Roosevelt served as twenty-sixth President of the United States from 1901
                  to 1909. This series mainly consists of correspondence written by Roosevelt dating
                  from the 1880s until just before his death in 1919. His letters reflect many of
                  the positions he held before being elected President including Civil Service
                  Commissioner under Presidents Harrison and Cleveland and President of the board of
                  New York Police Commissioners. They also frequently touch on his penchant for
                  writing as he corresponded with numerous editors and publishers for works covering
                  everything from politics to hunting. Many of the letters are marked "Personal" and
                  contain Roosevelt's private opinions on official subjects. He responds to
                  criticisms of all kinds, and offers many of his own criticisms, particularly with
                  regards to President Woodrow Wilson's handling of World War I and the treatment of
                  German-Americans. In an 1899 letter to Bartlett S. Johnston, Roosevelt insists he
                  will never be considered for President. The series is arranged alphabetically by
                  correspondent. Miscellaneous documents are housed in a folder at the end.</p>

               <p>George Washington was first President of the United States of America (1789-1797)
                  and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary
                  War. This collection of letters and documents written by Washington includes
                  correspondence with some of the most well-known early Americans including John
                  Adams, Nathanael Greene, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison.</p>
               <p>The earliest items in the series are Virginia land surveys conducted by Washington
                  in the 1750s. The bulk of the material dates from the years of the Revolutionary
                  War (1775-1783). Many of the letters detail the countless important decisions
                  Washington was forced to make as commander of America's revolutionary forces, from
                  issues of staffing and rank to how to adequately provision soldiers with clothing
                  and food. He wrote of his frustration with short enlistments and the need for more
                  soldiers, and defended his decision to have the troops winter at Valley Forge.</p>
               <p>The series also includes letters and documents from Washington's time as
                  President. His letters address questions of constitutional and congressional
                  powers, and highlight some of the ways the new country navigated international
                  diplomacy. The documents section contains two and half pages of an undelivered
                  inaugural address in Washington's hand.</p>
               <p>A handful of personal letters and documents include lists of slaves divided
                  between Washington and his brothers, and directions for the running of his Mount
                  Vernon estate.</p>
               <p>The correspondence is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent. <emph

                     <p>AMsS. Fragments of Washington's undelivered first inaugural address. [Before
                        his inauguration as President, Washington asked Colonel David Humphreys to
                        draft some remarks for the inaugural ceremony. Humphreys evidently responded
                        with a lengthy speech, which Washington copied onto 73 pages. This speech
                        was never used. In the 1820s, Washington biographer Jared Sparks came across
                        the speech and decided that since it bore little resemblance to the actual
                        speech given by Washington, it was not important to publish. He split up the
                        manuscript and gifted pages and pieces of pages to friends and family. The
                        entire manuscript has never been recovered, though parts of it have been
                        pieced together. This collection includes all of pages 5, 6, 23, and 24, and
                        the bottom third of pages 15 and 16. One of the fragments is bound in a
                        volume with a note on its provenance. More information about other recovered
                        pages is available in Presidential Series, Vol. 2: 152-177.]</p>

               <p>This series consists of the correspondence of Asa Waterman (1743-1789), who served
                  as a commissary for the American government during the Revolutionary War. Asa
                  Waterman was born May 1, 1743 in Norwich, Connecticut to Asa and Lucy Hyde
                  Waterman. In 1777 he married Anne Cooke Sterry (1752-1837), daughter of Governor
                  Cook of Providence, R.I. Before the outbreak of the war, Waterman served in
                  various military posts and operated as a ship merchant. His experience in dealing
                  goods undoubtedly contributed to his appointment as a commissary. Waterman was
                  among the first commissaries in America, as the commissariat system was
                  established during (and in response to) the Revolutionary War. Before then, the
                  provisioning of any military troops in the American colonies was conducted by
                  piecemeal contract with individual suppliers. As the fight for independence
                  escalated, the Continental Congress decided a more stable system was needed to
                  provide food, clothes, and weapons to the troops. Congress therefore established
                  the office of the Commissary General of Stores and Provisions in June 1775. The
                  structure and success of the commissariat system changed throughout the war.
                  Initially, Joseph Trumbull (1737-1778) was appointed Commissary General and was
                  given wide latitude to organize the commissariat system as he saw fit, with little
                  input from Congress. By 1777 it became clear more standards and regulations were
                  needed, causing Congress to reorganize the system. The department was split
                  between a Commissary General of Issues and a Commissary General of Purchases,
                  positions filled by William Buchanan and Jeremiah Wadsworth (1743-1804)
                  respectively. When this proved faulty, yet another revision was made whereby each
                  state was required to fulfill a quota of provisions. This last iteration of the
                  commissariat operated under the direction of Ephraim Blaine (1741-1804). Stationed
                  in Rhode Island, Asa Waterman appears to have started his tenure with the
                  commissariat around the time of the split into separate issue and purchasing
                  departments, though his titles and responsibilities reflect how unsuccessful the
                  split proved to be. From October 1777 to June 1779, Waterman was Assistant
                  Commissary of Issues, but he also helped with purchasing. In June 1779 he
                  officially switched to Assistant Commissary of Purchases. When the commissariat
                  was again reorganized into a state quota system, he remained in the service of
                  Rhode Island until August 1780 at which point he returned to his hometown of
                  Norwich, Connecticut, to serve as Deputy Commissary of Purchases. He appears to
                  have remained in Norwich until his death there in early 1789. The correspondence
                  in this series dates from Waterman’s years in Rhode Island (1777-1780). Included
                  are letters both to and from Waterman. The correspondents include military
                  officers requesting provisions, private suppliers writing about the availability
                  of certain goods, and most frequently other commissaries, notably Peter
                  Colt—Waterman’s superior who was in charge of purchasing for the entire "Eastern
                  Department" (comprised of New England and parts of New York). As a whole, the
                  series highlights two major themes. The first is the difficulty of provisioning
                  the troops with adequate, nutritious food due to a scarcity of staples (most often
                  flour) and the problem of shipping goods at the risk of enemy seizure. Creative
                  methods of "lengthening" food were encouraged (e.g. adding rice to flour to make
                  it last longer). The second theme is the frequent reorganization of the
                  commissariat system, resulting in new regulations that affected how and when
                  troops could be supplied. The constant change in rules and salaries clearly
                  frustrated Waterman, Colt, and other members of the Commissariat as evidenced by
                  many of the letters in this series. The papers are arranged chronologically.</p>

               <p>Woodrow Wilson served as president of Princeton University (1902-1911), Governor
                  of New Jersey (1911-1913), and twenty-eighth president of the United States
                  (1913-1921); this series includes letters written from all three offices. The
                  letters particularly highlight his involvement in publishing and reviewing written
                  works on political science and history. Of note are nearly thirty letters written
                  to illustrator Howard Pyle, which demonstrate Wilson's passion for history and
                  desire to be as historically accurate as possible in the text and illustrations of
                  his own works.</p>
