<p><emph render="bold">Biography of Francis Preston Blair</emph> </p><p> Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), journalist and politician, was born in Abingdon, Virginia, and raised in Kentucky. His grandfather, John Blair, held the first chair in theology at Princeton University. He graduated from Transylvania University in 1811 and married Eliza Violet Gist (1733-1877) a year later. Blair was admitted to the bar in 1817 but never practiced law. He became interested in Kentucky politics joining the New Court party and aiding his political ally, Amos Kendall, in editing the <emph render="italic">Argus of Western America</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Patriot</emph> in Frankfort. Blair became an advocate of Andrew Jackson, and on the advice of Kendall, Jackson called him to Washington in 1830 to become editor of the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, which became the official newspaper of the administration. A loyal Jacksonian, Blair was a confidential member of the Kitchen Cabinet and served Jackson faithfully from 1830 through 1837. The <emph render="italic">Globe</emph> continued to be a powerful voice through the Van Buren administration (1837-1841). Blair was forced to resign in 1845 by the new president, James K. Polk.</p><p> Retiring to his country estate, Silver Spring, in Maryland, Blair continued to exercise political power and influence, often through his sons, Francis "Frank" Preston (1821-1875) and Montgomery (1813-1883).</p><p>  <emph render="bold">Biography of Samuel Phillips Lee</emph> </p><p> Samuel Phillips Lee (1812-1897), an officer in the United States Navy, was born in Fairfax, Virginia, the son of Francis Lightfoot Lee, grandson of Richard Henry Lee, and great nephew of Francis Lightfoot Lee, both signers of the Declaration of Independence. In 1825 he was appointed a midshipman and proceeded to work his way through the ranks, becoming a rear-admiral in 1870. When commanding the <emph render="italic">Dolphin</emph> in 1851, Lee was employed in coastal survey duty making deep-sea soundings, testing currents, and searching for shallow ocean spots. His report of this work, <emph render="italic">The Cruise of the Dolphin</emph> (1854), was of considerable help to Matthew F. Maury, the oceanographer. During the Civil War, Lee remained loyal to the Union and participated in the Charleston blockade, the attack on New Orleans, and the battle of Vicksburg, and commanded both the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the Mississippi Squadron. After the war, he served at various posts, and his last command was as head of the North Atlantic fleet (1870-1872). In 1873 he retired from the navy.</p><p> While a young officer, Lee courted Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). After a lengthy courtship, Elizabeth Blair and Samuel Phillips Lee were married in 1843. Their only child, (Francis Preston) Blair Lee, was born in 1857. The family lived in Washington and at Silver Spring, Maryland, the country estate of Francis Preston Blair. After his retirement from the navy, Lee ran the day-to-day activities of the farm, and it was there that he died in 1897.</p><p>  <emph render="bold">Biography of Elizabeth Blair Lee</emph> </p><p> Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter of Francis Preston Blair and Eliza Violet Gist Blair, grew up in Washington, D.C., and Silver Spring, Maryland, immersed in the politics of the day. A favorite of Andrew Jackson, "Lizzie" lived in the White House for a time to please him. After she married Samuel Phillips Lee, a naval officer, in 1843, she often wrote to him keeping him up to date not only on family matters but also on local and national politics. She actively gathered this information through the comments of her father, editor of the Democratic organ, the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, and her brothers, Montgomery Blair, postmaster general under Lincoln, and Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., a general in the Civil War. Her political role also included serving as her father's amanuensis and sometime ghostwriter of his speeches.</p><p> Aside from being an avid follower of the political scene, Elizabeth Blair Lee spent much of her time raising her only child, (Francis Preston) Blair Lee, born in 1857; meeting the obligations of a large extended family; and participating in the busy social scene in Washington and Maryland. She also served for many years as a director of the Washington City Orphan Asylum. In 1906, Elizabeth Blair Lee died at Silver Spring where she had lived with her son and his family.</p><p>  <emph render="bold">Biography of Andrew Alexander Blair</emph> </p><p> Andrew Alexander Blair (1848-1932), son of Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., and grandson of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1866, being the youngest graduate to complete the full course up until that time. He served in the navy for two years and then resigned because of illness. Blair then became an analytical chemist and was a founding member of the firm of Booth, Garrett and Blair. He was well-known in his field, publishing many papers and reports.</p><p>  <emph render="bold">Biography of Blair Lee</emph> </p><p> Blair Lee (1857-1944), lawyer, legislator and social reformer, was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, the only child of Samuel Phillips Lee and Elizabeth Blair. He was educated at Princeton University (Class of 1880), where he was a founding member and president of the Ivy Club, and at Columbian (now George Washington) Law School earning a law degree in 1883. A practicing attorney in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, Lee also participated in Democratic politics, an interest which had been nurtured by his mother and grandfather, Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). He was twice elected to the Maryland State Senate (1905 and 1909), and among his accomplishments there was the passage of legislation establishing the primary law for party nominations and the creation of the Maryland State Roads Commission. Although narrowly defeated in 1911 in a race for governor of Maryland, Lee was elected to the United States Senate in 1913, the first senator elected under the 17th Amendment, in a special election following the death of Isidor Rayner. While in the United States Senate, he was active in passing legislation such as the Farm Loan Law, the amending of the Federal Reserve Law, and the Hay-Wadsworth Bill. A delegate to eight Democratic national conventions, he worked actively for the election of William Jennings Bryan (1896 and 1900) and Woodrow Wilson (1912 and 1916).</p><p> In 1891 he married Anne Clymer Brooke and, after her death (1903), helped raise their sons, Edward Brooke Lee (1892-1984, Princeton Class 1916) and Phillips Blair Lee (1895-1983, Princeton Class of 1918). Lee's interests included social reform and philanthropy, and he was active in the National Junior Republic, National Mary Washington Memorial Association, and the Washington City Orphan Asylum. He also participated in fraternal groups such as the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia, the Princeton Class of 1880 and the Ivy Club, and the K.F.R. Society.</p>  </bioghist>

Although a professional naval officer (1825-1873), Lee spent his retirement years (1873-1897) at Silver Spring Farm, the management of which had been transferred to him by his father-in-law, Francis Preston Blair. The collection reflects these dual careers as well as Lee's business interests in real estate, especially holdings in St. Louis, Missouri, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. An avid record keeper and commentator, his logs, journals, notebooks, and correspondence contain memoranda of explanation and insightful personal notations.</p><p> Of special interest is the correspondence between Lee and his wife, Elizabeth Blair Lee, during the long periods when he was at sea and she remained at home in Washington, D.C., observing and reflecting on the political and social scenes, especially during the Civil War years (1861-1864). The Civil War correspondence of Elizabeth Blair Lee, dating from December 5, 1861 to March 4, 1865, has been published in <emph render="italic">Wartime Washington: The Civil War Letters of Elizabeth Blair Lee</emph>, by Virginia Jeans Laas. The correspondence also contains letters by family members such as his brother, John Fitzgerald Lee (1813-1884), and sister, Frances A. Lee (1837-1889), as well as miscellaneous Blair and Lee family members. Also included are naval personnel such as surgeon John Croxall Palmer (1811-1883), scientist John Mercer Brooke (1826-1906), Gideon Welles (1802-1878), secretary of the navy during the Civil War, and Alexander Dallas Bache (1806-1867), superintendent of the Coast Survey. Many of the letters deal with promotions, transfers, and requests for supplies.</p><p> The documents contain both personal (naval appointments, powers of attorney, wills, and financial papers) and real estate (tax receipts, deeds, leases, insurance policies, and memoranda of agreement). About a quarter of Lee's papers contain naval records, coal records, lists of officers, passengers, and seamen, descriptions of ships, and prizes, to name but a few, for ships such as the <emph render="italic">Brandywine, Young Rover, Vandalia, Newborn, Dolphin, Severn, </emph>and <emph render="italic">Worcester</emph>. There are 101 maps in the collection pertaining to Lee's duty with the U.S. Coast Survey and later during the Civil War as commander of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the Mississippi Squadron.

id="aspace_78929d9840676d4b402ea0df36047402"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The papers of Blair Lee, lawyer and U.S. senator, consist of his writings, correspondence, legal files, documents, financial material, miscellaneous material, printed matter, and papers of others. The writings contain essays in literature, philosophy, and politics, and course notebooks in languages, science, the Bible, and other subjects while an undergraduate at Princeton (1876-1880), as well as notes taken at Columbian Law School (1880-1883), and manuscripts of political speeches.</p><p> The correspondence is indicative of the close relationship between Lee and his parents, Elizabeth Blair Lee and Samuel Phillips Lee, as well as the warm family ties he held with the extended Blair and Lee families and later with the Brooke family, the relatives of Anne Clymer Brooke Lee, whom he married in 1891. Of special interest are the letters to Lee written from France by his sons who served as officers in the U.S. army during World War I. The active political role Lee took on a local, county, state, and national level, culminating in his election to the U.S. Senate in 1913 to fill the unexpired term of Isidor Rayner (1850-1912), is reflected in the correspondence which includes letters by William Jennings Bryan (1860-1825), congressman and unsuccessful candidate for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908, President Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), and John Walter Smith (1845-1925), congressmen and senator from Maryland. The correspondence also includes letters regarding Lee's ill-fated Maryland gubernatorial race (1911) and the presidential election campaign of Woodrow Wilson (1912).</p><p> In addition, there are letters pertaining to Lee's legal and business interests, as well as general correspondence containing letters dealing with Grace Episcopal Church in Silver Spring, recreational clubs such as the Takoma Park Gun Club, Princeton and Ivy Club alumni activities, the administration of Silver Spring Farm, and friends dating back to Lee's youth and Princeton years. The correspondence also contains letterbooks including copies of his letters to family and friends, as well as political, legal, and business letters, and invitations, calling cards, and address books. Among the legal files are papers for cases handled by Lee, such as the Brown and Munsell gun case, the estates of Senator James Beck (1822-1890), Morgan Lester, Francis W. Lusby, Allan McLane (1823-1897), and Thomas W. Wise, as well as a challenge to the will of Judge Joseph Holt (1807-1894), references to some French spoliation claims, and many other miscellaneous cases. The documents and financial matters contain receipts, checkbooks, ledgers, account books, canceled checks, and insurance policies for Lee's farm, real estate holdings, and personal matters.</p><p> His interests encompassed legal, philanthropic, fraternal, and political groups, and the organizational files include correspondence, documents, and miscellaneous material in varying degrees for the District of Columbia Bar Association, the Metropolitan Club, the National Junior Republic, the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia, the National Mary Washington Association, the Washington City Orphan Asylum, and the Democratic National Publishing Company, primarily for the <emph render="italic">Silver Knight-Watchman.</emph> </p><p> The collection also includes family photographs, juvenilia, and memorabilia relating to Lee's early academic and religious training as well as his years at Princeton and Columbian Law School. There are political, legal, and business papers contained in the miscellaneous material of the collection, as well as blueprints, maps, and architectural renderings. Scrapbooks containing political newspaper clippings and other printed matter concerning Lee's political, legal, and business interests are included in the papers.</p><p> The material in papers of others pertains mainly to Lee's family as represented by his wife, parents, and sons, Edward Brooke Lee and Phillips Blair Lee as well as miscellaneous family members. Also found are the legal papers and correspondence of George H. Lamar (1865-1945) and William H. Lamar (1859-1928), lawyers of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and correspondence and printed matter of Judge Joseph Holt.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
