                <emph render="bold">Biography of Francis Preston Blair</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), journalist and politician, was born in Abingdon,
                Virginia, and raised in Kentucky. His grandfather, John Blair, held the first chair
                in theology at Princeton University. He graduated from Transylvania University in
                1811 and married Eliza Violet Gist (1733-1877) a year later. Blair was admitted to
                the bar in 1817 but never practiced law. He became interested in Kentucky politics
                joining the New Court party and aiding his political ally, Amos Kendall, in editing
                the <emph render="italic">Argus of Western America</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Patriot</emph> in Frankfort. Blair became an advocate of Andrew
                Jackson, and on the advice of Kendall, Jackson called him to Washington in 1830 to
                become editor of the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, which became the official
                newspaper of the administration. A loyal Jacksonian, Blair was a confidential member
                of the Kitchen Cabinet and served Jackson faithfully from 1830 through 1837. The
                    <emph render="italic">Globe</emph> continued to be a powerful voice through the
                Van Buren administration (1837-1841). Blair was forced to resign in 1845 by the new
                president, James K. Polk.</p>
            <p>Retiring to his country estate, Silver Spring, in Maryland, Blair continued to
                exercise political power and influence, often through his sons, Francis "Frank"
                Preston (1821-1875) and Montgomery (1813-1883).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Biography of Samuel Phillips Lee</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Samuel Phillips Lee (1812-1897), an officer in the United States Navy, was born in
                Fairfax, Virginia, the son of Francis Lightfoot Lee, grandson of Richard Henry Lee,
                and great nephew of Francis Lightfoot Lee, both signers of the Declaration of
                Independence. In 1825 he was appointed a midshipman and proceeded to work his way
                through the ranks, becoming a rear-admiral in 1870. When commanding the <emph render="italic">Dolphin</emph> in 1851, Lee was employed in coastal survey duty
                making deep-sea soundings, testing currents, and searching for shallow ocean spots.
                His report of this work, <emph render="italic">The Cruise of the Dolphin</emph>
                (1854), was of considerable help to Matthew F. Maury, the oceanographer. During the
                Civil War, Lee remained loyal to the Union and participated in the Charleston
                blockade, the attack on New Orleans, and the battle of Vicksburg, and commanded both
                the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the Mississippi Squadron. After the war,
                he served at various posts, and his last command was as head of the North Atlantic
                fleet (1870-1872). In 1873 he retired from the navy.</p>
            <p>While a young officer, Lee courted Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter
                of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). After a lengthy courtship, Elizabeth Blair and
                Samuel Phillips Lee were married in 1843. Their only child, (Francis Preston) Blair
                Lee, was born in 1857. The family lived in Washington and at Silver Spring,
                Maryland, the country estate of Francis Preston Blair. After his retirement from the
                navy, Lee ran the day-to-day activities of the farm, and it was there that he died
                in 1897.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Biography of Elizabeth Blair Lee</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter of Francis Preston Blair and Eliza
                Violet Gist Blair, grew up in Washington, D.C., and Silver Spring, Maryland,
                immersed in the politics of the day. A favorite of Andrew Jackson, "Lizzie" lived in
                the White House for a time to please him. After she married Samuel Phillips Lee, a
                naval officer, in 1843, she often wrote to him keeping him up to date not only on
                family matters but also on local and national politics. She actively gathered this
                information through the comments of her father, editor of the Democratic organ, the
                    <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, and her brothers, Montgomery Blair,
                postmaster general under Lincoln, and Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., a general
                in the Civil War. Her political role also included serving as her father's
                amanuensis and sometime ghostwriter of his speeches.</p>
            <p>Aside from being an avid follower of the political scene, Elizabeth Blair Lee spent
                much of her time raising her only child, (Francis Preston) Blair Lee, born in 1857;
                meeting the obligations of a large extended family; and participating in the busy
                social scene in Washington and Maryland. She also served for many years as a
                director of the Washington City Orphan Asylum. In 1906, Elizabeth Blair Lee died at
                Silver Spring where she had lived with her son and his family.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Biography of Andrew Alexander Blair</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Andrew Alexander Blair (1848-1932), son of Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., and
                grandson of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy
                at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1866, being the youngest graduate to complete the full
                course up until that time. He served in the navy for two years and then resigned
                because of illness. Blair then became an analytical chemist and was a founding
                member of the firm of Booth, Garrett and Blair. He was well-known in his field,
                publishing many papers and reports.</p>

                <emph render="bold">Biography of Blair Lee</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Blair Lee (1857-1944), lawyer, legislator and social reformer, was born in Silver
                Spring, Maryland, the only child of Samuel Phillips Lee and Elizabeth Blair. He was
                educated at Princeton University (Class of 1880), where he was a founding member and
                president of the Ivy Club, and at Columbian (now George Washington) Law School
                earning a law degree in 1883. A practicing attorney in Washington, D.C., and
                Maryland, Lee also participated in Democratic politics, an interest which had been
                nurtured by his mother and grandfather, Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). He was
                twice elected to the Maryland State Senate (1905 and 1909), and among his
                accomplishments there was the passage of legislation establishing the primary law
                for party nominations and the creation of the Maryland State Roads Commission.
                Although narrowly defeated in 1911 in a race for governor of Maryland, Lee was
                elected to the United States Senate in 1913, the first senator elected under the
                17th Amendment, in a special election following the death of Isidor Rayner. While in
                the United States Senate, he was active in passing legislation such as the Farm Loan
                Law, the amending of the Federal Reserve Law, and the Hay-Wadsworth Bill. A delegate
                to eight Democratic national conventions, he worked actively for the election of
                William Jennings Bryan (1896 and 1900) and Woodrow Wilson (1912 and 1916).</p>
            <p>In 1891 he married Anne Clymer Brooke and, after her death (1903), helped raise their
                sons, Edward Brooke Lee (1892-1984, Princeton Class 1916) and Phillips Blair Lee
                (1895-1983, Princeton Class of 1918). Lee's interests included social reform and
                philanthropy, and he was active in the National Junior Republic, National Mary
                Washington Memorial Association, and the Washington City Orphan Asylum. He also
                participated in fraternal groups such as the Society of the Cincinnati in the State
                of Virginia, the Princeton Class of 1880 and the Ivy Club, and the K.F.R.
                Society.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of the personal and family papers of five members of the
                    Blair and Lee families of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia -- Francis
                    Preston Blair (1791-1876); his daughter, Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906); her
                    husband, Samuel Phillips Lee (1812-1897); their son, Blair Lee (1857-1944,
                    Princeton Class of 1880); and his cousin, Andrew Alexander Blair (1848-1932) --
                    reflecting their various political, journalistic, naval, family, business,
                    legal, and domestic interests. While the collection largely pertains to these
                    five family members, their papers also contain a significant amount of
                    correspondence, documents, and writings of other members of the Blair and Lee
                    families. Among other topics, materials in this collection document the
                    families' involvement in American politics spanning from the Jacksonian Era
                    through World War I.</p>
                <p>The Blair family papers consist primarily of papers of politician and journalist
                    Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), including writings and lectures, documents,
                    family correspondence, articles and other materials related to his editorship of
                    the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, estate records, and correspondence with
                    prominent political figures, including many involved with the administration of
                    Andrew Jackson. The papers of his daughter, Elizabeth Blair Lee, document the
                    political and social lives of the Blair and Lee families, as well as her work
                    with the Washington City Orphan Asylum. The papers of Blair's grandson, Andrew
                    Alexander Blair, contain additional family correspondence and span his time at
                    the United States Naval Academy prior to becoming a chemist.</p>
                <p>The Lee family papers include the papers of Samuel Phillips Lee, which document
                    his service in the United States Navy, including his involvement in the U.S.
                    Coast Survey, as well as the management of the Silver Spring Farm, real estate
                    ventures, and family and domestic life. The papers of his son, the lawyer and
                    politician Blair Lee, relate to his life as a student, work as a lawyer and
                    United States senator during World War I and the administration of Woodrow
                    Wilson, service in various organizations, and personal and family life.</p>

                    <p>The papers of Francis Preston Blair, journalist and politician, consist of
                        writings, correspondence, documents, materials regarding Blair as a subject,
                        printed matter, papers of other persons, and additional papers. The writings
                        include his speeches, editorials, addresses, articles, essays, and general
                        works; these date from 1830, when Blair was called to Washington, D.C., by
                        President Andrew Jackson to edit the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, the
                        official newspaper of the Democratic administration. Although he never held
                        an elected office, Blair was considered a person of political importance and
                        influence in the mid-19th century, and his correspondence is indicative of
                        this, containing letters from Andrew Jackson (1767-1845), Martin Van Buren
                        (1782-1862), and Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), as well as senators Lewis Cass
                        (1782-1866), John Charles Fremont (1813-1890), and John Jordan Crittenden
                        (1787-1863), and congressmen Schuyler Colfax (1823-1885), Edward Livingston
                        (1764-1836), and Thomas Patrick Moore (1797-1853).</p>
                    <p>Also included is family correspondence, especially with his sons, Francis
                        "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr. (1821-1875, Princeton Class of 1841), lawyer,
                        general, and politician, and Montgomery Blair (1813-1883), lawyer,
                        statesman, and postmaster general in President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet,
                        and daughter, Elizabeth Blair Lee, wife of Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee and
                        mother of Blair Lee.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there are documents including Blair's last will and testament,
                        financial papers such as receipts, checks, checkbooks, and account books.
                        Among papers of others persons, there is correspondence of Andrew Jackson,
                        manuscripts contributed to the <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, and old
                        family papers, many of them relating to the family of Eliza Violet Gist,
                        Blair's wife.</p>
